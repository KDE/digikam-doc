==============================

To use digiKam to download images directly from your digital camera, connect the camera to your computer, switch the camera to the image display mode and turn it on. To download images from your phone's camera, it may be necessary to give your computer the rights to access the phone's contents. See your camera's user manual for more information.

The Import Interface helps you to get photographs into a digiKam Album, whether it is directly from your camera or scanner, from a USB mass storage device, via a card reader, or from a local or remote folder.
