How to make a screenshot for the manual with Alpha Blending 3D Border
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Never use advanced color theme to make screenshots. Always use desktop default color and icon set.

- Use Festival Import to take a shot. Use region selection option to select only
  important area. Remove buttons and dialog header to limit image file size.
  _ALWAYS use PNG file format to save image to prevent compression artifacts.

- Use script project/screenshot-dropshadow.sh to add border frame around the shot.
This script requires ImageMagick command line tools installed on the system.

The script can be run on a single file or in batch mode. To run in batch
mode, call it like this from within the images folder:

$> screenshot-dropshadow.sh -b png

where <png> is the file extenion to look for. The script can be used
with additional arguments, see '-h' for more options.

PNG screenshot optimizations
----------------------------

Since the documentation is very good it is also very demanding in terms of volume, 99% whereof are screenshots.

In order to limit the byte count to the minimum the following command chain shall be used to reduce the png file size.

A factor of 2-4 can be gained. From within the folder where the png reside, use script project/optpng.sh.
This script requires pngnq and optipng command line tools installed on the system.

To process all png files in one step : find *.png | xargs -0 ./makess.sh
