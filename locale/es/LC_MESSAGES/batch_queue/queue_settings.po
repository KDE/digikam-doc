"The **Queue Settings** area in the bottom left of the Batch Queue Manager is "

"multiple queues, which are shown as tabs in the **Queues** list, and each "
"queue can have its own settings. The Queue Settings display updates when you "
"switch from one queue to another by clicking on a queue tab in the "
"**Queues** list."

"results as **JPEG** files. When you want to save the results of batch "
"processing into a file type different than the original, you need to apply a "
