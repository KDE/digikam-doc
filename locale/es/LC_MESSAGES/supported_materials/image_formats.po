"Image compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression methods, "

"`Joint Photographic Experts Group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG>`_ is "

"In fact, most cameras save their images in this format unless you specify "
"otherwise. A JPEG image is stored using lossy compression, and you can vary "
"the amount of compression. This allows you to choose between lower "
"compression and higher image quality or greater compression and poorer "
"quality. The only reason to choose higher compression is because it creates "
"smaller files so you can store more images, making it easier to send them by "
"e-mail or post them on the Web. Most cameras give you two or three choices "
"equivalent to good, better, best, although the names vary."

"Although your camera is unlikely to support PNG, some people like to convert "

"JPEG, PNG images do not lose quality every time you re-encode them after "

"camera applies things like white balance, noise reduction, sharpening etc. "
"Storing photographs in a camera's RAW format allows you to alter settings, "
