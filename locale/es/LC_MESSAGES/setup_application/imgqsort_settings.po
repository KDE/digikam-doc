"These settings refer to the Image Quality Sorter tool which you can access "
"via Tools --> Maintenance. This tool is based on neural network to classify "
"items by the aesthetic quality and assign a Pick Label value accordingly. By "
"default the automatic sorting is enabled to simplify the workflow, but you "
"can turn off this feature and use customized settings based on basic factors."

"In the manual configuration mode, the four “Detect ...” options you can "
"choose which kind of fault should be factored in by the Image Quality "
"Sorter. Talking about factoring in: the factors for blur, noise and "
"compression can set with the help of the three “... Weight” adjustment bars "
"on the right."

"With the three “Assign ... Label ...” options you can decide to which image "
"quality level a label should be assigned. Un-checking all three of them "
"renders the Image Quality Sorter useless, of course. The thresholds for "
"these levels can be set through the three “... threshold” adjustment bars. "
"It will normally take some testing and trying out to find the settings that "
"suits your needs. Note that the input, i.e. the images the process has to "
"investigate, will have quite some influence. It's a difference whether you "
"choose an album containing images which are all more or less o.k. and have "
"only minor differences or if you present a collection of pictures where some "
"of the pictures really have some bad blur, noise, ... You also have to "
"consider at which point of your workflow you want to perform this operation. "
"Right after importing the files from your camera is probably a good idea."

"With the topmost of the adjustment bars you can adjust the speed of the "
"process in three steps. Slow speed (1) should lead to better results."
