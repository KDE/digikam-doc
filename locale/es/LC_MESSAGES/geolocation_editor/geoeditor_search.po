"In the **Search** tab you can look up places by their geographic names using "
"public geoname services **GeoNames** and **OpenStreetMap**. You just type in "
"a name of a place (city, monument, hotel, ...) into the input field at the "
"top and click on **Search** button. In the result list below you will get "
"something like this:"

"Obviously *Paris* does not only exist in France. So if you were looking for "
"the capital of France you can either scroll down the list until you find an "
"entry that undoubtedly belongs to there like *Arc de Triomphe* and click on "
"it or specify your search a little bit more precise like *Paris, Arc de "
"Triomphe* or *Paris, France*. Once you click on an entry in the list the map "
"will become centered to that place and you can now zoom in with the zoom-in "
"button (second from the left below the map). Using this example with "
"GeoNames you will notice that you still get a lot of results and even two "
"labeled only *Arc de Triomphe*, the second one a street a few hundred meters "
"away from the arch. With OpenStreetMap you get only one result. You got to "
"play a bit with the different services in different regions, with more or "
"less precise search terms and then you will get an idea about how to best "
"conduct your searches."
