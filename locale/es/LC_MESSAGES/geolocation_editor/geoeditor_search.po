"The **Search** tab allows you to look up places by their geographic names "
"using public geoname services **GeoNames** and **OpenStreetMap**. You just "
"type in a name of a place (city, monument, hotel, ...) into the input field "
"at the top and click on the **Search** button. The results of one such "
"search are shown below:"

"Obviously *Paris* does not only exist in France. So if you were looking for "
"the capital of France you can either scroll down the list until you find an "
"entry that undoubtedly belongs there, like *Arc de Triomphe*, and click on "
"it. Or you can refine your search to make it a bit more precise, like "
"*Paris, Arc de Triomphe* or *Paris, France*. Once you click on an entry in "
"the list, the map will shift to center on that place and you can now zoom in "
"with the zoom-in button (second from the left below the map). Using this "
"example with GeoNames you will notice that you still get a lot of results "
"and even two labeled only *Arc de Triomphe*, the second one a street a few "
"hundred meters away from the arch. With OpenStreetMap you get only one "
"result. You will have to play a bit using more or less precise search terms "
"with the different services in different regions in order to get an idea "
"about how to best conduct your searches."
