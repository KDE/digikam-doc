"A typical color workflow acquires images with a camera or scanner, displays "
"images on a monitor, and prints images on a printer. While each of these "
"devices may represent colors using 8-bit RGB values, they do not do so in "
"exactly the same way. Specifically, an RGB value of (200,130,200) will "
"probably correspond to different shades of purple on each of these devices. "
"The goal of color management is to adjust the RGB values of the image data "
"as it moves from input, to display, and on to print in such a way that "
"maintains the same perceived colors on all devices."

"In order to be able to convert from any color space to any other color "

"Thus two ICC conversions are shown in the diagram to convert data from a "

"**ICC profile** is a set of data that characterizes a color input or output "
"device, or a color space, according to standards promulgated by the "
"Interglobal Color Consortium (ICC). Profiles describe the color attributes "
"of a particular device (or the viewing requirements for an image) by "
"defining a mapping between the device source or target color space and a "
"profile connection space (PCS). This PCS is either CIELAB (L*a*b*) or "

"A simple example of one such conversion might be helpful. To apply a gamma "
"correction of 2.2 to a data value of 212 in an 8-bit representation, you "

"In theory, you should be able to do multiple conversions of an image from "

"**Assigning** a color profile changes the meaning of the RGB numbers in an "

"**HDR** and **LDR** do not refer to the bit-depth of the image. **High "

"to increase the dynamic range of the image. Only the number of discrete "
"steps from the brightest to the darkest tone in the image has changed. "
"Conversely, a 22-stop scene (way beyond the capacity of a consumer-oriented "
"digital camera without using multiple exposures) can be saved as an 8- or 16-"
"bit image, but the resulting image will exhibit extreme banding (that is, it "

"In 1931 the International Color Consortium decided to map out and "

"produced by differing combinations of wavelengths. Human color perception "
"depends on the fact that we have three types of cone receptors with peak "
"sensitivity to light at wavelengths of approximately 430, 540, and 570 nm, "
