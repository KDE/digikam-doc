"Camera or scanner profiles are applied to convert input images, and monitor "
"or printer profiles are applied to convert output images, but they are all "
"used to convert to or from the working color space that is used for editing "
"images. One of the first decisions that need to be made in color management "
"is the choice of a working color space."

"But why is this so complicated? Why can't you just edit images in the color "
"space described by the camera profile? After all, the camera profile should "
"provide the best *fit* to the colors recorded by your camera, as processed "
"by your RAW processing procedure, right? Working spaces, such as sRGB or "
"Adobe RGB, are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing. For "
"example when editing an image, pixels with equal values of RGB should appear "
"neutral or colorless. This just means that for any given pixel in an image "
"that has been converted to a suitable working space, if R=G=B you should see "
"a grey or black or white pixel on your screen. Many camera profiles violate "
"this *neutral* condition."

"However, there is one other good reason to not want to edit your image in "
"your camera profile color space. If you look at the size of a typical camera "
"profile, it is on the order of a quarter to a half a megabyte or more. In "
"order to get accurate color rendition of the RGB values that come out of the "
"RAW processor, the camera profile contains a lot of information about all "
"the changes that need to be made in different regions of color and tonality "
"in the original scene. The camera profile is accurate (at least for colors "
"in the original target) but not particularly mathematically smooth. Working "
"space color profiles, on the other hand, are very small in size (half a "
"kilobyte instead of half a megabyte) because they describe a color gamut in "
"terms of smooth, continuous mathematical functions, like the function used "
"for gamma correction. Working space profiles don't need to make allowances "
"for the *messiness* of real-world sensors, so the mathematical manipulations "
"performed during image editing can run faster and be more accurate than if "
"you try to edit your image while it is still in the camera color space."

"sRGB may be the most common working color space, but also serves as an "

"If you have a spiffy new monitor with a gamut larger than the gamut covered "
"by sRGB, you might want to use a monitor profile that takes best advantage "
"of your wonderful and hopefully calibrated and profiled monitor. But please "
"convert your image to sRGB before sending it on to your friends. sRGB is "
"also the color space that a lot of home and mass-production commercial "
"printers expect image files to be in when sent to the printer. It is also "
"the color space that most programs assume if an image does not have an "
"embedded color profile telling the program what color space should be used "

"How many discrete tonal steps are there in a digital image? In an 8-bit "

"(=16384 steps) pixel readings produced by the camera's A-to-D converter -- "
"the extra bits used to produce a 16-bit value start out as just zero "

"One major consideration in choosing a working space is that some working "
"spaces are bigger than others, meaning they cover more of the visible "
"spectrum (and perhaps even include some imaginary colors -- mathematical "
"constructs that don't really exist). These bigger spaces offer the advantage "

"But keeping all the possible colors comes at a price. It seems that any "
"given digital image (pictures of daffodils with saturated yellows being one "

"visible colors that your camera is capable of capturing. This small subset "

"So the conversion from your working space to your output device space (say "

"colors at best and at worst to banding (posterization - gaps in what should "
"be a smooth color transition, say, across an expanse of blue sky) and "
"clipping (your carefully crafted transitions across delicate shades of red, "
"for example, might get remapped to a solid block of dull red after "
