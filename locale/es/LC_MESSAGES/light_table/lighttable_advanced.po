"digiKam Light Table inherits some capabilities from the **Preview Mode** "
"since it shares many of the same tools used in the **Main Window**. One very "
"powerful feature is the Focus Points visualization that can be used when "
"comparing images side by side."

msgid ""
"Cameras can use some points (called auto focus or AF points) to assure that "
"a specific region of the image is in focus. A well-focused image may also "
"contain regions that are out-of-focus due to a limited depth of field, an "
"effect that is often used artistically. The AF points can often be pre-"
"defined by the camera or by the user, depending on the model of the camera."
msgstr ""

#: ../../light_table/lighttable_advanced.rst:27
msgid ""
"There are only two cases supported by digiKam for AF points: in-focused "
"points and selected points. In-focus points are the AF points determined by "
"the camera, and selected points are the AF points set by the user. An AF "
"point can also be both in-focus and selected, or neither."

"On many cameras, each focus point is not just a point, but a rectangular "
"region in the image. Focus Point displays an overlay of the focus region of "

"visualization while previewing images side-by-side allows you to easily "
"locate where the images should be in focus."
