"The Filters tab is used to limit the set of images displayed in the Image "
"Area. Normally one uses the Left Sidebar with its different views to confine "
"the images displayed for example to the content of an album or to images "
"with a certain label assigned to them. The Filters tab on the Right Sidebar "
"offers a number of filters and if one of these are filled in, selected or "
"checked only the cross-section of these two selections will be displayed in "
"the Image Area."

"To give an example, suppose you have a tag called 'public' which tags all "
"images except your private ones. Then you can check this 'public' tag in the "
"Right Sidebar to hide the private images (all those not having 'public' "
"tag). Whatever view mode you chose from the Left Sidebar, only 'public' "
"images will be displayed. Another typical example is the selection of a "
"subset of tags in a hierarchical tree. Suppose you want to display 'red' and "
"'green' from a tag tree containing 7 different colors as sub-tags. Simply "
"click on the 'color' tag of the main view and check 'red' and 'green' from "
"the Right Sidebar."

"You can also use a combination of the filters but here we have to look a "
"little bit closer: The main filters and also the different types of labels "
"in the Labels Filter (color, pick, rating) are connected with boolean AND "
"which means that all selected filters have to fit for the images to be "
"displayed. If you select 'JPG' in the MIME type filter and 'red' in the "
"labels filter only those photographs from the selection on the Left Sidebar "
"will be displayed that have JPG format AND are labeled 'red'."

"On the other hand the tags in the tag filter and the individual labels "
"within one type of labels are connected with boolean OR as you might have "
"noticed already in the public/private example above. That means if you check "
"more than one tag in the Tags Filter all images with at least one of these "
"tags applied will show up (as long as they are not ruled out by one of the "
"other filters)."

"Another use of this tab of the Right Sidebar is drag-and-drop tagging. Lets "
"say you chose with the help of the Left Sidebar a number of images to tag "
"them and they are now displayed in the Image Area. If the tag already "
"exists, simply drag it from the Right Sidebar onto one of the icons. A "
"dialog will pop-up and ask if this tag should be applied to this item only, "
"to all items or, if there is more than one icon selected (highlighted), to "
"the selected items."

"In the above example the main window shows the images from a calendar date, "
"the tag filter is set to 'Oldtimer', which reduces the set to 3 images. In "
"the Text Filter I typed “Funeral” which leaves only one picture of the only "
"funeral car oldtimer in my collections. Then a tag is dragged from the Tag "
"Filter over the icon and dropped. A pop-up dialog asks if the tag shall be "
"applied to this item only or to all (displayed) items."

"Note that the Text Filter has a little drop-down menu to select which image "
"information should be included in the search and the rating group in the "
"Labels Filter has one to choose whether you want a certain rating or a range."
