"by the icon |icon_collection|) or at least one if you haven't added one or "
"more yet in the :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure digiKam...` and "
"**Collections** section. Each Collection represents a folder branch on your "
"hard disk, on removable media or on network shares and the next levels in "
"the tree show the structure of those folders, here called **Albums**. The "
"albums can be sorted by their folder layout on the hard disk, by the "
"Category that has been set in the :ref:`Album Properties <managing_albums>` "
"or by the Date of that Albums (this date can also be changed in the "
"Properties of each Album). You can invert the sort order (ascending/"
