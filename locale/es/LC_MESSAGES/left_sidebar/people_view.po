"The face management workflow helps you identify and recognize people in your "

"Occasionally, you may encounter special cases where the recommended face "
"detection settings don't yield the best results. In those cases, you should "
"tune the detection settings for a single image or small group of images.  It "
"is not recommended to change the default settings for normal use, and it is "
"recommended to change the settings back to their default values when you're "
"done with special cases."

"**Large Group Photos**: You may have images of large groups of people, and "
"you want to generate a face tag for every person in the image. Using the "
"YuNet detection model, setting the **Detection Accuracy** to 1, and setting "
"the **Face size** to **Extra Small** should detect most, if not all of the "
"faces in the image.  This will also incorrectly tag more areas of the image "
"as faces (false positives)."

"**Portraits**: When shooting portraits from the shoulder up, especially with "
"modern high-resolution cameras over 40 megapixels, face recognition may not "
"detect the face or may tag multiple areas of a single face. Using the YuNet "
"detection model, setting the **Detection Accuracy** to 8, and setting the "
"**Face size** to **Extra Large** will detect only the face, and eliminate "
"false positive tag regions."
