"sRGB is widely accepted as a standard color profile by virtually everyone "
"involved with consumer-oriented imaging. sRGB was proposed in 1996 by "
"Hewlett Packard and Microsoft as a standardized color space for consumer-"
"oriented applications. As stated in the initial proposal:"

"Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft propose the addition of support for a standard "
"color space, sRGB, within the Microsoft OS's, HP products and the Internet. "
"The aim of this color space is to complement the current color management "
"strategies by enabling a third method of handling color in the OS's and the "
"Internet that utilizes a simple and robust device-independent color "
"definition that will provide good quality and backwards compatibility with "
"minimum transmission and system overhead. Based on a colorimetric RGB color "
"space well suited to Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors, televisions, scanners, "
"digital cameras, and printing systems, such a space can be supported with "
"minimum cost to software and hardware vendors."

"Currently, the ICC (International Color Consortium) tracks and ensures that "
"a color is correctly mapped from the input to the output color space, by "
"attaching a profile for the input color space to the image in question. This "
"is an appropriate approach for high end users.  However, there are a broad "
"range of users that do not require this level of color quality, a broad "
"range of file formats that will never support color profile embedding, and a "
"broad range of uses that discourage people from appending any extra data to "
"their files. It is at this level that a common standard RGB color space "
"becomes useful and necessary."

"A common standard RGB color space addresses these issues by merging the many "
"standard and non-standard RGB monitor spaces into a single standard RGB "
"color space. Such a standard could dramatically improve the color fidelity "
"in the desktop environment. For example, if operating system vendors provide "
"support for a standard RGB color space, the input and output device vendors "
"that support this standard color space could easily and confidently "
"communicate color without further color management overhead in the most "
"common situations."

"To summarize, the point of the by-now almost universally adopted sRGB color "
"space was and is to make life easier for consumers (no need to worry about "
"color management), less expensive for manufacturers (no need to worry about "
"compatibility between consumer-level digital cameras or scanners, monitors, "
"printers, and so forth), and more convenient for displaying images on the "
"Internet (don't worry about embedding and reading ICC profiles - just assume "
"sRGB)."

"sRGB was designed to contain colors easily displayed on consumer-oriented "

"This least-common-denominator set of viewable and printable colors - the "

"digital cameras can capture, much smaller than the set of colors today's "
"printers can print, and much smaller than the color gamut of the new wide-"
"gamut monitors that are beginning to enter the consumer market. The gamut of "
"sRGB is simply too small to use the wider color gamuts available today even "
"at the consumer level. Conversely, if you don't intend to make use of an "

"If you choose to work exclusively in the sRGB color space, do you need to "

"There are several possible consequences of working with an uncalibrated "
"monitor, none of them good. Every monitor, calibrated or otherwise, has a "
"native (uncalibrated) white point, expressed as a color temperature in "
"degrees Kelvin. The white point of a monitor (calibrated or not) is the "
"color you see when you are looking at a patch of pure white on your screen. "
"Pure white is when the RGB values in your image all equal 255 (as expressed "
"in 8-bits), such as the plain white background of a web page or an office "
"document. You are thinking, *white is white* but if you were able to line up "
"several monitors calibrated to different white points, you would see that "
"the higher the temperature of the monitor's white point, the bluer the "
"screen looks in comparison with monitors with lower white points."

"You can see this for yourself by using the controls on your own monitor to "

"white point, will easily discern the screen getting bluer and yellower as "
"you move the white point higher and lower. If your uncalibrated monitor is "
"too blue, you will overcompensate as you edit your image, producing images "
"that will look yellowish and too warm on a properly calibrated monitor. "
"Conversely, if your monitor is too yellow because the color temperature is "
"set too low (LCD native color temperature is around 5500K while sRGB assumes "
"6500K), your images will look blueish/too cool on a properly calibrated "

"Setting a proper white point is only part of monitor calibration. You also "

"If your monitor gamma is improperly set, your tonal variations from dark to "
"light will be off. That is, the shadows or highlights might be overly "
"compressed or expanded, leading you to compensate in the opposite direction. "
"So when viewed on a properly calibrated monitor, the shadows might be too "
"bright or dark (or the highlights too dark or bright), with the rest of the "
"image suffering from tonal over-compression. And heaven help you if the "
"internal color channel gains of your monitor are improperly set, because the "
"resulting color casts - too green, too magenta, too orange, etc. that you "
"will inevitably create by *correcting* your image during editing - are very "

"Whether or not your monitor is properly calibrated, you might be surprised "

"You may be surprised that there is a difference between calibrating a "
"monitor and profiling a monitor. Calibration is a process where a device is "
"brought into some defined state by making adjustments to its controls or "
"some other physical means. For example, the act of calibrating a monitor "
"involves adjusting its **white point**, **black level**, **luminosity** and "
"**gamma** to predetermined or standard values using the monitor's controls "
"and by altering the video card settings."

"In contrast to calibration, the process of creating a profile is a "
"characterization of the device that does not involve making any changes or "
"adjustments to the device. Rather it is a measurement process that results "
"in a file that contains a precise mathematical description of the device's "
"color and tonality characteristics. This file is an **ICC profile**. These "
"characteristics include the transfer function from the device's color space "
"to a standardized absolute color space (this is called a Profile Color Space "
"in an ICC profile), the device's **white point**, **black point**, "
"**primaries** and other information. Displays are normally characterized "
"(profiled) in their calibrated state."

"Calibrating your monitor technically is not really part of color management. "
"But obviously a properly profiled monitor is a prerequisite for a color-"
"managed workflow. This manual does not cover the important topics of how to "
"calibrate and profile a monitor. The documents available at `Argyll <http://"
"www.argyllcms.com/>`_ are very good and highly recommended reading. To use "
"this software to calibrate and/or profile your monitor, you will need a "
"spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer (sometimes called a *spider*) is a "
"device for measuring the RGB values of color patches projected onto the "
"monitor screen by calibration/profiling software such as Argyll. The Argyll "
"website maintains an up-to-date list of supported spectrophotometers."

"There are various methods given on the Internet for calibrating a monitor "
"without using a spectrophotometer. These *eye-ball* methods are better than "
"not calibrating your monitor at all, and depending your eyeball and your "
"monitor, can produce quite usable results. But the eye-ball methods are not "
"a true substitute for a properly calibrated and profiled monitor. For the "
"record, calibrating and profiling a monitor with a spectrophotometer, though "
"intimidating at first, is not difficult. Spectrophotometers can be obtained "
"for well under 100€. (If you opt for a more expensive model, make sure you "
"are paying for a better piece of hardware, rather than just a more fully-"
