"The point of a color-managed workflow is to ensure that the colors coming "
"from your camera or scanner have a predictable relationship with the colors "
"you actually photographed or scanned, that the colors displayed on your "

"A typical color workflow acquires images with a camera or scanner, displays "
"images on a monitor, and prints images on a printer. While each of these "
"devices may represent colors using 8-bit RGB values, they do not do so in "
"exactly the same way. Specifically, an RGB value of (200,130,200) will "
"probably correspond to different shades of purple on each of these devices. "
"The goal of color management is to adjust the RGB values of the image data "
"as it moves from input, to display, and on to print in such a way that "
"maintains the same perceived colors on all devices."

"Color management works by characterizing the color reproduction capability "

"so they can be used to translate the RGB numbers used to represent a "
"specific color at one point in the workflow, into the appropriate RGB "
"numbers to represent the exact same color at another point in the workflow. "

"In order to be able to convert from any color space to any other color "
"space, it was decided that all ICC profiles would be defined so that they "
"can convert between the device color space and a common working color space. "
"Thus two ICC conversions are shown in the diagram to convert data from a "
"camera into data suitable for display on a monitor: one from the camera to "
"the working space, and one from the working space to the monitor. So color "
"management is largely a matter of using the appropriate device profiles to "

"**ICC profile** is a set of data that characterizes a color input or output "
"device, or a color space, according to standards promulgated by the "
"Interglobal Color Consortium (ICC). Profiles describe the color attributes "
"of a particular device (or the viewing requirements for an image) by "
"defining a mapping between the device source or target color space and a "
"profile connection space (PCS). This PCS is either CIELAB (L*a*b*) or "
"CIEXYZ. Mappings may be specified using tables, to which interpolation is "
"applied, or through a series of parameters for transformations."

"working space, working space to PCS, and PCS to monitor. The reasons for "
"these extra steps are described below.)"

"**Gamma correction** is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode "

"A simple example of one such conversion might be helpful. To apply a gamma "
"correction of 2.2 to a data value of 212 in an 8-bit representation, you "

"In theory, you should be able to do multiple conversions of an image from "

"**Assigning** a color profile changes the meaning of the RGB numbers in an "

"**Linear** has two related and easily confused definitions. *Linear* can "

"**HDR** and **LDR** do not refer to the bit-depth of the image. **High "

"accommodate 8 or 9 stops), can be saved as an 8-, 16-, 32-, or even 64-bit "
"image, depending on your software. But storing with more bits does nothing "
"to increase the dynamic range of the image. Only the number of discrete "
"steps from the brightest to the darkest tone in the image has changed. "
"Conversely, a 22-stop scene (way beyond the capacity of a consumer-oriented "
"digital camera without using multiple exposures) can be saved as an 8- or 16-"
"bit image, but the resulting image will exhibit extreme banding (that is, it "

"In practice this color space that spans human perception is not a color "

"profile is needed to accurately characterize or describe the response of a "
