"The goal of templates is to apply multiple pieces of metadata to one or more "
"items at the same time. You can create many different profiles corresponding "
"to different aspects of your workflow. In all cases, the information will be "
"stored in the file as either XMP or IPTC metadata. Remember that XMP is a "
"replacement of IPTC as explained :ref:`in this section <iptc_tags>` of the "
"manual."

"The top portion of the templates view shows a list of the already existing "
"templates. The first column shows the title of the template, and the second "
"column shows the name of the author(s) in the “Author Names” field of that "
"template. To the right you have three editing buttons, below an input field "
"for the template title. To create a new template you type a title in the "
"input field and click the **Add** button. The new template will appear in "
"the list. To edit an existing template you select it in the list, edit its "
"fields (see next paragraph) and then click the **Replace** button. You can "
"also type in a new title for the edited template and save the new version "

"**Authors** (synonymous to *Creator and By-line*): This field should contain "

"identity of the photographer needs to be protected) the name of a company or "

"**Author Positions** (synonymous with *By-line title*): This field should "

"Commercial Photographer. Since this is a qualifier for the Author field, the "
"Author field must also be filled out. With IPTC, this field is limited to 32 "

"**Credit** (synonymous with *Provider*): Use the credit field to identify "

"author. If a photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or "
"the Associated Press, these organizations could be listed here as they are "
"\"providing\" the image for use by others. If the image is a stock "

"**Copyright**: The Copyright Notice should contain any necessary copyright "
"notice for claiming the intellectual property, and should identify the "
"current owner(s) of the copyright for the photograph. Usually, this would be "
"the photographer, but if the image was done by an employee or as work-for-"
"hire, then the agency or company should be listed. Use the form appropriate "
"to your country. For the United States you would typically follow the form "
"of (c) {date of first publication} name of copyright owner, as in *(c) 2005 "
"John Doe.* Note, the word *copyright* or the abbreviation *copr* may be used "
"in place of the (c) symbol. In some foreign countries only the copyright "
"symbol is recognized and the abbreviation does not work. Furthermore the "
"copyright symbol must be a full circle with a *c* inside; using something "
"like (c) where the parentheses form a partial circle is not sufficient. For "
"additional protection worldwide, use of the phrase, \"all rights reserved\" "
"following the notice above is encouraged. In Europe you would use: Copyright "
"{Year} {Copyright owner}, all rights reserved. In Japan, for maximum "
"protection, the following three items should appear in the copyright field "
"of the IPTC Core: (a) the word, Copyright; (b) year of the first "
"publication; and (c) name of the author. You may also wish to include the "
"phrase *all rights reserved*."

"In general the IPTC Subject Codes are quite comprehensive but on the other "

"subjects, even though they always remain private (or company) subjects. A "
"way to do that in digiKam is to first check **Use standard reference code** "
"and select *10001004* which brings you to *Lifestyle* and *Leisure/Games/"
"shogi* - just to continue with our example. Then you check **Use custom "
"definition** and change the last digit of **Reference** to 5 and the text in "
"the **Detail** field to - say *domino*. You save this custom definition to "
"the template by clicking **Add** button at the right side of the subjects "
"list. Then you type in a template title (if it's a new template) and save "
"the template by clicking the **Add** button at the right side of the "
"templates list. Don't mix up these two."
