"Image metadata is textual information that can be attached to digital images "
"in order to annotate, describe and categorise them. This information is "
"useful for searching and indexing images and for accessibility services. "
"There are three standard formats in which image metadata can be stored: "
"Exif, IPTC and XMP. They concentrate on different properties of the image "
"and are used for different purposes. digiKam provides tools for viewing and "
"editing image metadata in all these formats."

"The application offers metadata editing tools available through the Edit "
"Metadata menu entry. The metadata editor conveniently arranges all metadata "
"into sections for each kind of metadata chunk, making it easier to find and "
"edit specific entries. For example, to edit hardware-related information, "
"switch to the Device section. Here you can modify device manufacturer, "
"device model, exposure-related settings, and other information."

"In addition to Exif, IPTC and XMP formats are supported, so you can perform "
"the described actions on metadata stored in these metadata chunks as for "
"Exif. Remember that Exif is dedicated to store camera information, where "
"IPTC and XMP are more used to store post-process text information such as "
"rights management. So, it is not recommended to edit the metadata injected "
"by the camera that took the photograph; on the other hand, you can add "
"information about the author, copyright, etc. Detailed description of "
"supported entries is available online."

"Note that you can synchronise some specific metadata entries from one chunk "
"to another one, as for example the comments which is available in Exif, "
"IPTC, and XMP as separate entries. Mark the check boxes corresponding to the "
"entries you wish to copy from one format to another."

"Note that synchronising metadata may produce undesired results because Exif "
"is limited to pure ASCII character set."
