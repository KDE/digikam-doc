"The `Mosaic-Wall <https://github.com/scheckmedia/ImageMosaicWall>`_ tool "
"creates a mosaic image based on a bunch of other images. This tool is not "
"included in the digiKam source code. Rather, it is a 3rd-party plugin "
"included in binary distributions of digiKam, including the Windows, macOS, "
"and Linux bundles."

"First, you need to select one item from your collection to render as a "
"matrix of photo. To start the Mosaic-Wall tool, head to the **Tools** tab "
"from the **Right Side-bar**. You will find the **Image Mosaic Wall** icon on "
"the list. You can also start it from the :menuselection:`Tools --> Image "
"Mosaic Wall` menu entry. The tool dialog will open as follows:"

"The next button **Set Image Folder** allows you to set the directory where "
"the images to display on the matrix are stored. The tool analyzes all the "
"photos in this directory to select where each image should be applied to the "
"matrix. The images are reduced in size and placed over the base image using "
"a smart comparison of the shape of the resized image and the base image "
"shape of the part to cover. When the analysis is complete, the tool "
"indicates the number of files parsed in the folder that will be used to fill "
"the matrix."
