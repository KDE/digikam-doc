"The Time Adjust tool available from :menuselection:`Item --> Adjust Time & "
"Date` :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+D` allows to adjust or write the timestamps in file "
"metadata. This common task is sometime mandatory when your images do not "
"contain dates in metadata (typically when the contents were digitized by a "
"scanner), or when a camera records a wrong date in you file due to an "
"incorrectly set clock. With this tool, you can choose the right source to "
"take the date information, the date entries to fix or append, and the "
"calculation to before on dates before saving them."
