"We recommend this sequence of image editing steps to ensure optimum "

"TIFF for storing photographs. Otherwise you'll lose a bit every time you "
"save the results. If you can afford it, use 16 bit/channel for your best "
"shots. If you want to change color space, in particular if you want to work "
