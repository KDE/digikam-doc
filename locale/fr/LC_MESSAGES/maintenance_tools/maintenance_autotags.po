"The **Auto-Tags Assignment** scans the images in your collection using a "
"neural network that has been trained to identify common objects. The objects "
"identified by the neural network are then used to tag each image. When the "
"scan is complete, you can search your database for images containing a bird, "
"or a ball, or a car. Tags generated by the **Auto-Tags Assignment** process "
"will be under the **auto** tag in the Tags view to distinguish them from "
"tags that have been manually assigned."

"**Scan mode**: The scan mode determines if digiKam will scan all images, or "
"only images that don't have an **auto** tag already assigned. The **auto** "
"tag is assigned to images that have been auto-tagged. The **auto** tag is "
"not assigned to images that have been manually tagged."

"**Auto-tagging Mode**: When applying auto-tags, you can choose between "
"**Update** and **Replace Existing**. **Update** will add any new auto-tags "
"to the existing tags on the image. **Replace Existing** will remove all "
"existing auto-tags and replace them with the tags detected by the current "
"scan. Any tags not under the **auto** tag will not be affected. This setting "
"is useful if you want to run multiple scans with different settings and "
"combine the results."

"**Detection Model**: The detection model is the neural network used to "
"detect objects in the image. The default model is **EfficientNet B7**. The "
"**EfficientNet B7** model is a general-purpose model that can detect 1,000 "
"different objects and scenes. The **YOLOv11-Nano** model is faster and uses "
"less memory than the **EfficientNet B7** model. The **YOLOv11-Nano** model "
"is recommended for users with limited memory or slower processors, and "
"**YOLOv11-XLarge** is recommended for users with more memory and faster "
"processors. Both YOLOv11 models are trained to detect 80 different objects "
"based on the COCO dataset."

"**Accuracy**: Lower accuracy settings may detect more objects in an image, "
"but it will also increase the number of incorrectly identified objects "
