"Image compression is the application of data compression algorithms to "
"digital images. Image compression reduces redundancy in the image data in "
"order to be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Image compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression methods, "
"especially applied before transformations like cropping, resizing, and color "
"corrections, are always preferred for archival purposes because they "
"preserve the original data. In contrast, lossy compression methods introduce "
"compression artifacts, especially when used at low bit rates. Lossy methods "
"are suitable for natural images such as photos in applications where minor "
"(sometimes imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a "
"substantial reduction in file size. For example, lossy compression is good "
"for publishing images on the Internet."

"`Joint Photographic Experts Group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG>`_ is "
"a compressed format that trades some image quality for smaller file sizes. "
"In fact, most cameras save their images in this format unless you specify "
"otherwise. A JPEG image is stored using lossy compression, and you can vary "
"the amount of compression. This allows you to choose between lower "
"compression and higher image quality or greater compression and poorer "
"quality. The only reason to choose higher compression is because it creates "
"smaller files so you can store more images, making it easier to send them by "
"e-mail or post them on the Web. Most cameras give you two or three choices "
"equivalent to good, better, best, although the names vary."

"`Tagged Image File Format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF>`_ has been "

"be stored by the camera in uncompressed form or using a lossless compression "
"algorithm (Deflate). It maintains higher image quality but at the expense of "
"much larger file sizes. Some cameras let you save your images in this "
"format, and it is a popular format because of it is a lossless compression "

"`Portable Network Graphics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"

"is a lossless format like TIFF but is much more compact, saving disk space. "
"Although your camera is unlikely to support PNG, some people like to convert "
"their photographs to PNG as soon as they get them on their computer. Unlike "
"JPEG, PNG images do not lose quality every time you re-encode them after "
"modification. digiKam fully supports PNG images and the Batch Queue Manager "

"PGF compares well with JPEG 2000 but it was developed for speed (compression/"
"decompression) rather than to be the best at compression ratio. At the same "
"file size a PGF file looks significantly better than a JPEG file, while also "
"remaining very good at progressive display. Thus it should be well-suited "

"coding formats, for example both SDR and HDR images. HEVC is an image and "

"It competes with HEIC, which uses the same container format built upon the "

"Some, typically more expensive, cameras allow you to store images in RAW "

"camera applies things like white balance, noise reduction, sharpening etc. "
"Storing photographs in a camera's RAW format allows you to alter settings, "
"such as white balance, after the photograph has been taken. Most "
"professional photographers use RAW format, because it offers them maximum "
"flexibility. The downside is that RAW image files can be very large indeed."
