"An easy-to-use camera interface is provided that will download photographs "
"directly from your digital camera into digiKam Albums. More than `2700 "
"digital cameras <http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php>`_ are "

"Most current digital cameras store data on Compact Flash™ Memory cards and "
"use USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-link) connections for data transmission. "
"The actual transfers to a host computer are commonly carried out using the "
"USB Mass Storage device class (so that the camera appears as a disk drive) "
"or using the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. "
"Alternatively, older cameras may use a Serial Port (RS-232) connection."

"digiKam employs the gPhoto library to communicate with digital still "
"cameras. gPhoto is a free, redistributable set of digital camera software "
"applications which supports a growing number of cameras. gPhoto has support "
"for the Picture Transfer Protocol, which is a widely supported protocol "
"developed by the International Imaging Industry Association to allow the "
"transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral "
"devices without the need of additional device drivers."

"Many older digital still cameras used the Serial Port to communicate with "
"host computers. Because photographs are big files and serial port transfers "
"are slow, this connection is now obsolete. digiKam still supports these "
"cameras and performs image transfers using the gPhoto program. You can find "
"a complete list of supported digital cameras at `this url <http://www.gphoto."

"gPhoto needs to be built with libexif to properly retrieve thumbnails for "

"libgphoto2 camera drivers. If Exif support is not set with gPhoto, you might "
"not see thumbnails or the thumbnail extraction may be very slow."

"**USB Mass Storage**: a computer interface using communication protocols "

"This standard provides an interface to a variety of storage devices, "

"**FireWire Mass Storage**: a computer interface using communication "
