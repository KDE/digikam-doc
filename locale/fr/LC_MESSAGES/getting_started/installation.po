"If you update digiKam to a new major version, for example from version 7 to "

"<database_intro>`, since the internal schema may have changed. Typically, "
"digiKam is able to migrate tables from an older version to a new one, and "
"all of this is done automatically at startup. But it's always better to save "
"these important files before upgrading the application. See the :ref:"
