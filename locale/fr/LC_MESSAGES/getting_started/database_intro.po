"Databases are used to store data. Like other photograph management programs, "
"digiKam uses its database to avoid data duplication, reduce data redundancy, "
"enable fast search, and guarantee data integrity. Using a database also "
"drastically reduces the cost of data entry, storage and retrieval. "
"Additionally, any user can access the data using a query language."
