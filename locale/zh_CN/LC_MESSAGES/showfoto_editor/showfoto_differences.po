"One main difference between Showfoto and the digiKam Image Editor is the "
"lack of support for any database. Showfoto deals directly with the file-"
"metadata for all loaded files. Since Showfoto is just an editor that does "
"not support all the capabilities of a photo management program, such as a "
"powerful search tool, it's not necessary to cache file information in a "
"database."

"As Showfoto does not use a database, the application lacks **image "
"versioning** support."

"Other differences with the digiKam Image Editor is the **Left Sidebar**. In "
"Showfoto all photo management is delegated to the Main Window and the left "
"sidebar hosts two tabs to navigate through your file system:"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`Folders <showfoto_folderstab>` tab allows you to navigate through "
"directory hierarchies like a standard file manager. You can see the image "
"thumbnails and the current path. Clicking on a thumbnail will load the "
"contents to the canvas."

"The :ref:`Stack <showfoto_stacktab>` tab hosts your preferred items "

msgid ""
"The **Right Sidebar** is exactly the same as in the Image Editor, except for "
"the tabs that depend exclusively on the database - **Captions** and "
"**Versions** are not available in Showfoto. Look in :ref:`this section "
"<right_sidebar>` of this manual to find information about the tabs presented "
"in Showfoto."
