"There are some things to be considered before you process, or even shoot in "
"RAW format. Uncompressed RAW image file formats store all of the information "
"obtained by the camera for each image. There are also some compressed RAW "
"formats that store the same information after application of reversible, "
"lossless compression algorithms. Many photographers prefer to take pictures "
"in RAW mode because digital image post-processing can often produce better "
"quality images than the camera's built-in conversion algorithms."
msgstr ""
"不过在处理 RAW 文件之前（甚至拍摄之前），有几点要注意：RAW 格式会保留相机拍到"
"的所有原始数据，一点不压缩。也有压缩版的 RAW，但用的是无损压缩算法，解压后数"
"据一点不丢。很多摄影师爱用 RAW 格式拍照，因为后期修图的效果往往比相机直出的效"
"果更好。"

"The RAW files include data from each physical pixel in the camera's focal "
"plane. For most digital cameras this means recording four color channels for "
"each color pixel in the final image: one red, one blue, and two green "
"channels. Often these channels are recorded to a bit depth greater than the "
"8 bits used in most common image formats. In addition, the white balance of "
"the digital camera is stored in a RAW image, so it can be applied to the "
"image in post-processing. Demosaicing is the step taken to convert this raw "
"4-channel data to the standard 3-channel RGB representation used in standard "
"image formats like JPEG and TIFF. That is the job of the RAW Converter tool."

"The RAW conversion in digiKam is based on `Libraw <https://www.libraw.org/"
">`_, which supports many, but not all, RAW formats. Don't expect to produce "
"exactly the same images as software provided by the camera vendor, but "
"sometimes libraw gives better results. See :ref:`this section "
"<camera_profiles>` of this manual for details."

"Next adjust the available check and value boxes to optimize the RAW "
"conversion process in the Batch Queue Manager settings view. Settings are "
"available to adjust demosaicing and white balance, apply noise reduction, or "
"manage the color profile. If you find the results of a RAW conversion are "
"not quite optimal, don't worry, it is always possible to fine-tune the image "
"later on. A detailed description of the **RAW Decoding** settings is "

"接着在批处理管理器的设置界面里，调整各种复选框和数值框来优化转换效果。这里可"

"For RAW files, you must add a format conversion tool to the end of Assigned "
"Tools list that specifies the output format used to save the results file. "
"The file name will stay the same by default, only the extension changes. "
"**JPEG** uses a lossy algorithm that often produces the smallest output file "
"size. In contrast, the tagged image format (**TIFF**) preserves all image "
"information using a lossless LZW compression."

"处理 RAW 文件时，记得在\"已指定工具\"列表最后加个格式转换工具，用来指定输出格"

"Don't use the **JPEG** format if you intend to perform a lot of editing on "
