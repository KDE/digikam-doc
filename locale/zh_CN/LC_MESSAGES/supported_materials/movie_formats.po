"digiKam is capable of reading video metadata, such as movie length, video "
"frames per second, video size, and encoding options. Video metadata is "
"automatically read during files scans and stored in the digiKam database so "
"you can search for videos based on their metadata. digiKam allows you to "
"play video in embedded preview mode, and from within a slideshow. If you are "
"using the USB Mass Storage connection mode, then digiKam even allows "
"previewing video from your camera device before downloading."
