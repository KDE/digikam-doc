"Image compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression methods, "

"preserve the original data. In contrast, lossy compression methods introduce "
"compression artifacts, especially when used at low bit rates. Lossy methods "
"are suitable for natural images such as photos in applications where minor "
"(sometimes imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a "
"substantial reduction in file size. For example, lossy compression is good "

"`Joint Photographic Experts Group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG>`_ is "

"In fact, most cameras save their images in this format unless you specify "
"otherwise. A JPEG image is stored using lossy compression, and you can vary "
"the amount of compression. This allows you to choose between lower "
"compression and higher image quality or greater compression and poorer "
"quality. The only reason to choose higher compression is because it creates "
"smaller files so you can store more images, making it easier to send them by "
"e-mail or post them on the Web. Most cameras give you two or three choices "
"equivalent to good, better, best, although the names vary."

"Storing photographs in a camera's RAW format allows you to alter settings, "
