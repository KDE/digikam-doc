"digiKam characterizes every image by a fingerprint (or signature), that is "
"internally represented as a lengthy number. These fingerprints are computed "
"in such a way that the less numerical difference there is between any two "
"image fingerprints, the more the two images resemble each other. Comparison "
"of these fingerprints thus make it possible to find similar images. This "
"methodology is the core engine for three features in the Similarity View "
"named find **Duplicates**, find similar **Image**, and find by **Sketch**."

"Before you can have digiKam find duplicates, the fingerprints of the images "
"within the collections have to be calculated. You can start that process "
"with the button **Update Fingerprints** which initiates a total rebuild of "
"the image fingerprint database. This may take hours if you have a large "
"collection and slow storage devices. If you have already scanned your images "
"for fingerprints, then you should skip this step."

"You can also perform fingerprint operations using :menuselection:`Tools --> "
"Maintenance` and select **Rebuild Finger-prints** option. You can optionally "
"choose if you want to rebuild the entire database or only scan your database "

"changed or new items is naturally the faster option."

"Once the fingerprints are calculated you can use **Find Duplicates**, but "
"the calculation will take a long time since it has to compare every image "
"with every other image. So it is often better to confine your search to "
"certain **Albums** and/or **Tags**. The **All albums** and **All tags** "
"check-boxes perform global searches in the database. Otherwise use the drop-"
"down menu to specify which **Albums** and/or **Tags** to search."

"The fundamental result of a **Find Duplicates** operation is a list of "
"Reference images, which should be thought of as originals, and the number of "
"images found that are duplicates of the reference image. A **Remove "
"Duplicates** operation would then remove the duplicate images, without "
"disturbing the reference images. But when digiKam identifies a group of "
"duplicate images, how does it identify which is the reference image that "
"should be maintained, and which are the duplicates?"
