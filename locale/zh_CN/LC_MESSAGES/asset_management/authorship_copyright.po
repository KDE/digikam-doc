"One of the last steps in tagging your digital images may be to add "
"authorship, ownership, and copyright tags. Unlike 'the good(?) old days' of "
"paper copies, the ubiquitous Internet makes it just too easy to 'steal' a "
"picture from a web site. At the very least, all images that will be exported "
"and/or published in any form, should have embedded authorship and copyright "
"information as part of their metadata. Including this information allows you "
"to legally prohibit others from reproducing, adapting, or distributing "
"copies of your work."

"**Copyright**: The Copyright Notice should contain any necessary copyright "

"current owner(s) of the copyright for the photograph. Usually, this would be "
"the photographer, but if the image was done by an employee or as work-for-"
"hire, then the agency or company should be listed. Use the form appropriate "
"to your country. For the United States you would typically follow the form "
"of © {date of first publication} name of copyright owner, as in 'copr 2005 "
"John Doe.' The word 'copyright' or the abbreviation 'copr' shall be used in "
"place of the (c) symbol as only ASCII characters are allowed. In some "
"foreign countries only the copyright symbol is recognized and the "
"abbreviation does not work. Using something like (c) where the parentheses "
"form a partial circle is not sufficient. For additional protection "
"worldwide, use of the phrase, 'all rights reserved' following the notice "
"above is encouraged. In Europe you would use: Copyright {Year} {copyright "
"owner}, all rights reserved. In Japan, for maximum protection, the following "
"three items should appear in the copyright field of the IPTC Core: (a) the "
"word, Copyright; (b) year of the first publication; and (c) name of the "

"年份) + 版权所有者，比如\"copr 2005 John Doe\"。只能用 “copyright” 或缩写 "
"“copr” 代替 © 符号（因为只支持 ASCII 字符）。在某些国家只认 © 符号，缩写无"

"如果在日本，为了最大限度保护，IPTC核心元数据的版权字段应包含：(a) Copyright "
