"This will be the last chapter and step to mark your digital library with "
"authorship, ownership and copyright or left information. More than in 'the "
"good(?) old days' of paper copies, the ubiquitous Internet makes it just too "
"easy to 'steal' a picture from a web site. At the very least, for all images "
"that will be exported and/or published in any form, the authorship and "
"copyright information should be part of their metadata. Nothing more simple "
"to do with digiKam: you can setup the default identity, and any images "
"ingested be digiKam will be automatically informed. We put copyleft in the "
"title for a reason (citation from wikipedia):"

"Copyleft is a play on the word copyright and is the practice of using "
"copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified "
"versions of a work for others and requiring that the same freedoms be "
"preserved in modified versions."

"Copyleft is a form of licensing and may be used to modify copyrights for "
"works such as ... music, and art. In general, copyright law allows an author "
"to prohibit others from reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of the "
"author's work. In contrast, an author may, through a copyleft licensing "
"scheme, give every person who receives a copy of a work permission to "
"reproduce, adapt or distribute the work as long as any resulting copies or "
"adaptations are also bound by the same copyleft licensing scheme. A widely "
"used and originating copyleft license is the GNU General Public License. "
"Similar licenses are available through Creative Commons - called Share-alike."

"**Author** (synonymous with Creator and By-line): This field should contain "
"your name, or the name of the person who created the photograph. If it is "
"not appropriate to add the name of the photographer (for example, if the "
"identity of the photographer needs to be protected) the name of a company or "
"organization can also be used. Once saved, this field should not be changed "
"by anyone. This field does not support the use of commas or semi-colons as "
"separator."

"**Author** title (synonymous with By-line title): Linked to Author. This "
"field should contain the job title of the photographer. Examples might "
"include titles such as: Staff Photographer, Freelance Photographer, or "
"Independent Commercial Photographer. Since this is a qualifier for the "
"Author field, the Author field must also be filled out."

"**Credit** (synonymous to Provider): Use the Provider field to identify who "
"is providing the photograph. This does not necessarily have to be the "
"author. If a photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or "
"the Associated Press, these organizations could be listed here as they are "
"'providing' the image for use by others. If the image is a stock photograph, "
"then the group (agency) involved in supplying the image should be listed "
"here."

"**Source**: The Source field should be used to identify the original owner "
"or copyright holder of the photograph. The value of this field should never "
"be changed after the information is entered following the image's creation. "
"You should consider this to be a write-once field. The source could be an "
"individual, an agency, or a member of an agency. To aid in later searches, "
"We suggest to separate any slashes '/' with a blank space. Use the form "
"'photographer / agency' rather than 'photographer/agency.' Source may also "
"be different from Creator and from the names listed in the Copyright Notice."

#: ../../asset_management/authorship_copyright.rst:43
msgid ""
"**Copyright Notice**: The Copyright Notice should contain any necessary "
"copyright notice for claiming the intellectual property, and should identify "
"the current owner(s) of the copyright for the photograph. Usually, this "
"would be the photographer, but if the image was done by an employee or as "
"work-for-hire, then the agency or company should be listed. Use the form "
"appropriate to your country. For the United States you would typically "
"follow the form of © {date of first publication} name of copyright owner, as "
"in 'copr 2005 John Doe.' The word 'copyright' or the abbreviation 'copr' "
"shall be used in place of the (c) symbol as ASCII characters only are "
"allowed. In some foreign countries only the copyright symbol is recognized "
"and the abbreviation does not work. Using something like (c) where the "
"parentheses form a partial circle is not sufficient. For additional "
"protection worldwide, use of the phrase, 'all rights reserved' following the "
"notice above is encouraged. In Europe you would use: Copyright {Year} "
"{copyright owner}, all rights reserved. In Japan, for maximum protection, "
"the following three items should appear in the copyright field of the IPTC "
"Core: (a) the word, Copyright; (b) year of the first publication; and (c) "
"name of the author. You may also wish to include the phrase 'all rights "
"reserved.'"

"Whereas it is paramount to fill-in the author and copyright sections, they "
"represent no protection against fraud. Anyone with a bit more than basic "
"computer knowledge is able to delete or modify image embedded metadata. The "
"solution to this problem is called 'digital watermarking'. To private "
"persons this might be of little interest for the majority of photographs, "
"but for professionals ans semi-professionals this protection is really "
"important."

"Digital Watermarking refers to an invisible digital watermark that is being "
"impressed on photographs as an element of digital rights management (DRM). "
"The watermark contains the same information of authorship and copyright as "
"described above, but the metadata is encrypted and saved in the actual image "
"data (as opposed to the metadata section which is a separate section within "
"the image file). This invisible imprint has holographic properties so that "
"modifications done to an image (size, color, crop, up to a certain limit) "
"will not destroy the copyright information. Only when an image is resized to "
"a very small fraction like a thumbnail will the embedded information be "
"lost, but then the image is of no value anymore to the copyright infringing "
"party. The digital watermark will be unique per image."
