"digiKam provides a number of methods to classify photographs: filenames, "
"albums, collections, time-stamp, tags, rating, GPS position and captions. As "
"if this was not enough, you can search many standard metadata items like "
"camera model, lens, coordinates, image size and many more. Metadata "
"categories as listed here are in fact different **views** of your photo "
"library. Combining these views is the very powerful method to narrow down "
"the search for a file and to find it quickly. Imagine having 800 photos of "
"your loved one. Searching for **Salagou**, having more than **3 rating "
"stars**, shot in **France** will surely leave you with very few candidates. "

"just one of those criteria or none. At the beginning, at the time of taking "

"The first thing to do and to know before you put anything onto your system "

"Lets take a simple yet frequent example: you are a casual photographer "
