"Digital Asset Management (DAM) refers to every part of the process that "
"follows taking a picture, from downloading the data to your computer, all "
"the way through final output and permanent storage. Anyone who shoots, scans "
"or stores digital photographs is practicing some form of DAM, but most of us "
"are not doing so in a systematic or efficient way."

"digiKam supports most DAM tasks by providing a unique and comprehensive set "

"in  your collection. This makes most DAM tasks fast and easy to perform. "
"digiKam is based on open standards, so it will not confine you to a platform "
"or lock you into a single application. It instead puts you onto the fast "
"track to manage and find your photographs, allowing you to move on to any "
"other platform, application, or system without losing any of your work. "

"The ability to make exact copies is one key thing that differentiates the "
"archiving of digital images versus film. Digital images can be copied "
"exactly, so you can make as many new originals as you want. In contrast, "
"there is one original for a film image, and all copies made from that "
"original will have a slightly lower quality. And if that wasn't bad enough, "
"both the film original and any copies are slowly aging and disappearing. The "
"only way to keep a film image *forever fresh* is to make a digital copy of "
"it. And that is also the only way to protect it from all hazards."

"Yet some may object that digital media don't last forever. In fact, the "
"lifespan of today's digital media may be shorter than many types of film. "
"But you can maintain digital media forever by periodically making new copies "
"(e.g. every 1, 5, or 10 years), and always keeping at least 2-3 copies of "
"the files in different physical locations. This is why digital images can be "
"archived and protected against aging, fire and flood in a way that film "
"never could. The good and bad news is then this: if you lose digital images "
"and data, you will only have yourself to blame."
