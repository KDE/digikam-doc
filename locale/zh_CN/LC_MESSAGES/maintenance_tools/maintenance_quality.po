"The quality **score** to determine the **Pick Label** property can be "
"evaluated in one of two ways: using four basic factors for each image "
"(**Blur**, **Noise**, **Exposure**, and **Compression**), or using a **deep "
"learning neural network engine**."

"The first approach helps to determine whether the basic factors have "
"compromised image quality, however the output depends on fine-tuning made "
"the user and it does not include any assessment of the aesthetic value of "
"the image."

"The second approach uses an artificial intelligence engine based on `this "
"model <https://expertphotography.com/aesthetic-photography/>`_ to predict an "
"aesthetic score. As deep-learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesnâ€™t "
"require hyper-parameter settings, which makes this approach far easier to "
