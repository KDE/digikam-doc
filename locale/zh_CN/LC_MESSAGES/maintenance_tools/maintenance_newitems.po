"The **Scan for New Items** tool will scan the collections you defined "
"in :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure digiKam...` and the "
"**Collections** dialog page, looking for image files you have added to your "
"collections while digiKam was not running. New entries are added to the "
"digiKam database corresponding to each new image file found during the scan."

"Be aware that scanning for new items at startup can take a while, slowing-"
"down application initialization. If your computer is fast enough, the "
"background scan will have no effect on the usability of digiKam while "
"scanning. Scanning can introduce delays if your collections are huge or if "
"you use a remote database. In these cases you may want to disable automatic "
"scans and instead use the maintenance tool to perform a manual scan when "
"necessary."

"Another option from this setup panel named **Fast scan (detects new, deleted "

"digiKam uses a hash to identify files quickly and register items changes in "
"the database while scanning. For performance reasons this is not a full hash "
"of the file, but the file size is included, so it's reliable enough. digiKam "
"uses these same parameters to try to find files during a scan that have been "
"externally moved or renamed. To have make the scan process as efficient as "
"possible, we recommend doing file operations within digiKam, avoiding "
"changing files and folders using external applications such as a file "
"manager."
