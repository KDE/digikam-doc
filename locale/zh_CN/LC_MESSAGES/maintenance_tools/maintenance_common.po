"In the **Common Options** section you can restrict the scope of the "
"maintenance process(es) to certain albums or tags. You got to un-check "
"**Whole albums collection** or **Whole tags collection** to get access to "
"the drop down fields where you can select albums or tags. Note that in this "
"drop down field you have a context menu to select or deselect children and/"
"or parents and also to invert the selection. If you switch from **Albums** "
"to **Tags** or vice versa your selection in the now grayed out item will "
"remain untouched which might be useful if you need a certain selection more "
"often."
