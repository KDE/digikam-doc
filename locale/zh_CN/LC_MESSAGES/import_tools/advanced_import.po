"Cameras often do not use very meaningful filenames for photographs. The "
"filenames are usually reused once the photographs have been deleted from the "
"camera. This can lead to filename clashes if you download photographs from "
"many shootings into the same Album. It can also be useful to include the "
"date and time that an image was taken into the filename."
