"These settings refer to the Image Quality Sorter tool which you can access "
"via :menuselection:`Tools --> Maintenance`. This tool is based on **neural "
"network** to classify items by the aesthetic quality and assign a **Pick "
"Label** value accordingly. By default the automatic sorting is enabled to "
"simplify the workflow, but you can turn off this feature and use customized "
"settings based on basic factors."

"In the manual configuration mode, the four **Detect ...** options you can "
"choose which kind of fault should be factored in by the Image Quality "
"Sorter. Talking about factoring in: the factors for blur, noise and "
"compression can set with the help of the three **... Weight** adjustment "
"bars on the right."

"With the three **Assign ... Label ...** options you can decide to which "
"image quality level a label should be assigned. Un-checking all three of "
"them renders the Image Quality Sorter useless, of course. The thresholds for "
"these levels can be set through the three **... threshold** adjustment bars. "
"It will normally take some testing and trying out to find the settings that "
"suits your needs. Note that the input, i.e. the images the process has to "
"investigate, will have quite some influence. It's a difference whether you "
"choose an album containing images which are all more or less o.k. and have "
"only minor differences or if you present a collection of pictures where some "
"of the pictures really have some bad blur, noise, ... You also have to "
"consider at which point of your workflow you want to perform this operation. "
"Right after importing the files from your camera is probably a good idea."
