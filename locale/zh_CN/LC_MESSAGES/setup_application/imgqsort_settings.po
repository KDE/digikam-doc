"The **Image Quality Sorter** options for digiKam are set "
"from :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure digiKam... --> Image Quality "
"Sorter page`. These settings refer to the Image Quality Sorter tool which "
"you can access via :menuselection:`Tools --> Maintenance`. This tool uses a "
"**neural network** that has been trained to assess the aesthetic quality of "
"images and assigns a **Pick Label** value based on that assessment. By "
"default the neural network-based sorting is enabled to simplify the "
"workflow, but you can turn off this feature and use customized settings "
"based on some basic factors."

"The first three options allow you to automatically assign rejected/pending/"

"The **Detect Aesthetic Image using Deep Learning** option enables the "
"automatic assessment of quality using the trained neural network. This is "
"the simplest method and is the default option."

"The **Detect Quality Using Basic Factors** is also an automatic process, but "
"has far more controls to adjust. Enabling this option means the images are "
"evaluated in terms of 1 to 4 quality factors, in order to produce a quality "
"score that ranges from 0 to 100."

"The thresholds levels for low, medium and high-quality images are set "

"some experimentation to find the settings that best suit your needs."

"The four **Detect ...** options allow you to choose which kind of images "
"faults (blur, noise, compression, or under/over exposure) should be weighed "
"in quality evaluation. And the relative weights of three of these factors "
"are also adjustable."

"The quality of the images the process has to investigate, will influence how "
"well this works. An album containing images which are all more or less o.k. "
"will produce quite different results than an album where some of the "
"pictures suffer from bad blur, noise, ... So you'll have to experiment with "
"the threshold settings and weights to get useful results. You should also "
"consider where in your workflow you want to perform this operation. You may "
"find it most useful to apply this operation right after importing the files "
"from your camera."
