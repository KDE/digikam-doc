"One practical consequence of the gamma of a working space is that the higher "
"the gamma, the more discrete tones are available for editing in the shadows, "
"with consequently fewer tones available in the highlights. Changing the "
"gamma of an image redistributes the number of tones available in the lighter "
"and darker areas of an image. Theoretically, if you are working on a very "
"dark-toned (low key) image you might want a working space with a higher "
