"digiKam The Vignetting correction is a tool to correct image vignetting "
"(under-exposure in the corners)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:95
msgid ""
"Wide angle lenses, especially those used in medium and large format "
"photography, frequently do not uniformly illuminate the entire sensor plane. "
"Instead, they *vignette* (shade) the edges and corners of the image, "
"substantially reducing the light reaching the sensor there. But telelenses "
"may show vignetting too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:97
msgid ""
"The traditional solution for this is to attach a *center filter* to the "
"lens. This is a neutral density filter with maximum density at the optical "
"axis of the lens, clear at the periphery, with density varying inversely to "
"the vignetting of the lens. A center filter has many advantages: not only "
"does it automatically correct for full-frame images but, since it's fixed to "
"the front of the lens, it also compensates for the off-center vignetting "
"which occurs when camera movements are employed for perspective or plane of "
"focus adjustment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:99
msgid ""
"But there are disadvantages as well. Many center filters require a 1.5 or 2 "
"f-stop filter factor adjustment, which may in turn necessitate a shutter "
"speed so slow (since wide angle lenses, even with center filters, are best "
"used at apertures of f/16 or smaller) that hand-holding the camera is "
"impossible and motion blur becomes a problem when photographing moving "
"objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the wide exposure range of present-day film and the color (or grey-"
"scale) depth of digital camera or film scanners, it is possible to simulate "

"Five sliders give you control over the vignetting correction filter, and "

msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:114
msgid ""
"**Amount**: this option controls the degree of luminosity attenuation by the "
"filter at its point of maximum amount. The default amount is 2.0, which "
"corresponds to an optical filter with a 1 f-stop filter factor (or, by no "
"coincidence, a factor of 2 in luminosity). Increase the amount to compensate "
"for a greater degree of vignetting; reduce it for less."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:116
msgid ""
"**Feather**: this option determines the rate at which the filter intensity "
"falls off from the point of maximum amount toward the edges, expressed as a "
"power factor. The default of 1 yields a linear reduction in filter amount "
"with distance from the center. Power factors greater than 1.0 cause a faster "
"fall-off (for example, a power of 2 causes the amount to decrease as the "
"square of the distance from the center) and causes the effect of the filter "
"to be concentrated near the center. Powers less than 1 spread out the amount "
"of the filter toward the edges; a power of 0.5 causes the amount to fall as "
"the square root of the distance from the center."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:118
msgid ""
"**Radius**: this option specifies the radius, as a multiple of the half "
"diagonal measure of the image, at which the amount of the filter falls off "
"to zero (or, in other words, becomes transparent). The default value of 1.0 "
"specifies a filter which is transparent at its corners. A radius "
"specification greater than 1 extends the effect of the center filter beyond "
"the edges of the image, while a radius less than one limits the filter's "
"action to a region smaller than the image. When compensating for vignetting "
"by lenses used with large format and some medium format cameras, the default "
"radius factor of 1 is rarely correct! These lenses often \"cover\" an image "
"circle substantially larger than the film to permit camera movements to "
"control perspective and focus, and consequently have a vignetting pattern "
"which extends well beyond the edges of the film, requiring a radius setting "
"greater than 1 to simulate a center filter covering the entire image circle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:120
msgid ""
"**X offset** and **Y offset** settings: these options moves respectively the "
"center of the filter horizontally or vertically up to the border of the "
"image by the specified percentage. A negative value for the X offset will "
"shift the filter to the left while a positive value will shift it to the "
"right. A negative value for the Y offset will move the filter up, and "
"finally a positive value will move it down."

"**Add Vignetting**: many photographs looks flat because of a distracting "
"background or another composition matter. While most of time you will want "
"to remove vignetting it is a fact that a selective vignetting could improve "
"the readability of a photograph and draw the eyes to the intended subject. "
"As an artist you may choose this option, ticking it will invert the filter "
"thus darkening the corners of a photograph."

"The only way to be sure which settings of **Amount**, **Feather**, and "
"**Radius** best compensate for the actual optical characteristics of a given "
"lens is to expose a uniformly illuminated scene (for example, a grey card "
"lit by diffuse light) and perform densitometry on the resulting image (for "
"example with Adjust Level tool histogram position bar). Failing that, or "
"specifications by the lens manufacturer giving the precise degree of "
"vignetting at one or more working apertures, you may have to experiment with "
"different settings to find those which work best for each of your lenses. "
"For help you in this task, the widget dialog provide a thumbnail mask "
"rendering applied on the image. Fortunately, the response of the human eye "
"is logarithmic, not linear like most digital imaging sensors, so you needn't "
"precisely compensate for the actual vignetting to create images which "
