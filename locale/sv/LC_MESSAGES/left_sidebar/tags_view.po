"Tags, also known as keywords in some applications, are an essential feature "
"in digiKam. They are used to organize, categorize, and facilitate the "
"retrieval of digital assets. Here are some key uses of tags:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:20
msgid ""
"**Organization**: Tags help in structuring and organizing large collections "
"of digital assets by assigning labels to each asset. This enables users to "
"group related assets together and maintain a logical arrangement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:22
msgid ""
"**Searchability**: By tagging assets with relevant keywords, users can "
"easily :ref:`search <search_view>` and find specific assets. Tags enhance "
"the search functionality, making it quicker and more efficient to locate "
"files based on their content, theme, or other attributes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:24
msgid ""
"**Categorization**: Tags allow users to categorize assets into different "
"groups or categories based on specific criteria. This is particularly useful "
"for managing diverse collections of assets, such as images, videos, "
"documents, and more."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:26
msgid ""
"**Metadata Enhancement**: Tags contribute to enriching the metadata "
"associated with each asset. This additional information can include "
"descriptions, keywords, and other relevant details, providing more context "
"and making the assets more informative."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:28
msgid ""
"**Workflow Automation**: Tags can be used to automate workflows within "
"digiKam. For example, assets tagged with a certain label can be used in "
"various tools like facial recognition and image quality scanning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:30
msgid ""
"**Collaboration**: Tags facilitate collaboration by allowing team members to "
"easily share and access tagged assets. This ensures that everyone involved "
"in a project can quickly find the necessary resources."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:32
msgid ""
"**Version Control**: Tags can help in managing different versions of an "
"asset by labeling them with version numbers or other identifying "
"information. This makes it easier to track changes and maintain the "
"integrity of the asset."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:34
msgid ""
"Overall, tags are a powerful tool in digiKam that enhance organization, "
"improve searchability, and streamline workflows, making it easier to manage "
"and access digital assets efficiently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:36
msgid ""
"By arranging tags in a hierarchical tree, you can maintain a logical and "
"systematic structure. The ability to collapse sections of the tree in the "
"Tags list further enhances navigation, making it easier to locate the "
"desired tags."
msgstr ""

#: ../../left_sidebar/tags_view.rst:38
msgid ""

"But before assigning and using tags, you first have to define them. If you "
"import photographs that already have assigned tags, digiKam will build an "
"appropriate tag tree during import. Alternatively, you can use digiKam's "
"auto-tags feature to find objects in your images and create tags. The "
"context menu shown in the screenshot above provides an easy approach to "
"managing tags."

"In this tag tree the keyword *Cat* appears three times. This will not cause "
