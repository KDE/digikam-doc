"Occasionally, you may encounter special cases where the recommended face "
"detection settings don't yield the best results. In those cases, you should "
"tune the detection settings for a single image or small group of images.  It "
"is not recommended to change the default settings for normal use, and is "
"recommended to change the settings back to their default values when you're "
"done with special cases."

"**Large Group Photos**: You may have images of large groups of people, and "
"you want to generate a face tag for every person in the image. Using the "
"YuNet detection model, setting the **Detection Accuracy** to 1, and setting "
"the **Face size** to **Extra Small** should detect most, if not all of the "
"faces in the image.  This will also incorrectly tag more areas of the image "
