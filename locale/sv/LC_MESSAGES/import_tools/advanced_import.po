"The camera drivers used to import images cannot always read the file "

"the thumbnail, etc., may be incomplete before download. But the import uses "
"the file metadata read *after* download to perform all file renaming and "

"between the information displayed in the import view and the actual metadata "
"used to import and organize your collections."
