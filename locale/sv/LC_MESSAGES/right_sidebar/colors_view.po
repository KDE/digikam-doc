"The Histogram Viewer shows the statistical distribution of color values in "

"Color images can be decomposed into **Red**, **Green** and **Blue** color "
"channels. Some images also include an **Alpha** channel that supports "
"transparency (like PNG or GIF images). Each channel supports a range of "
"intensity levels from 0 to 255 (integer valued). Thus, a black pixel is "
"encoded by 0 on all color channels; a white pixel by 255 on all color "
"channels. A transparent pixel is encoded by 0 on the alpha channel; an "
"opaque pixel by 255."

"With the **Scale** option you can determine whether the histogram will be "
"displayed using a linear or logarithmic vertical axis. The **Linear** mode "
"is usually the most useful for images taken with a digital camera. However,  "
"a **Linear** histogram for images that contain substantial areas of constant "
"color will often be dominated by a single bar. In this case a "
"**Logarithmic** histogram may be more useful."
