"These settings refer to the Image Quality Sorter tool which you can"
" access via Tools --> Maintenance. This tool is based on neural network"
" to classify items by the aesthetic quality and assign a Pick Label value"
" accordingly. By default the automatic sorting is enabled to simplify the"
" workflow, but you can turn off this feature and use customized settings"
" based on basic factors."

"With the three “Assign ... Label ...” options you can decide to which"
" image quality level a label should be assigned. Un-checking all three of"
" them renders the Image Quality Sorter useless, of course. The thresholds"
" for these levels can be set through the three “... threshold” adjustment"
" bars. It will normally take some testing and trying out to find the"
" settings that suits your needs. Note that the input, i.e. the images the"
" process has to investigate, will have quite some influence. It's a"
" difference whether you choose an album containing images which are all"
" more or less o.k. and have only minor differences or if you present a"
" collection of pictures where some of the pictures really have some bad"
" blur, noise, ... You also have to consider at which point of your"
" workflow you want to perform this operation. Right after importing the"
" files from your camera is probably a good idea."
