"**Quality**: digiKam offer many alternative interpolation algorithms. The "
"most common are **Bilinear**, **VNG**, and **AAHD** interpolations. It seems "
"that AAHD (for Ameliored Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) is the best choice "
"for quality according to some tests that we have performed and the paper of "
"the person that implemented it. This improved method based on **AHD** "
"interpolation, selects the direction of interpolation so as to maximize a "
"homogeneity metric, thus typically minimizing color artifacts. VNG (for "
"Variable Number of Gradients) was the first algorithm used by libraw but "
"suffers from color artifacts on the edge. Bilinear is interesting if you are "
"looking for the fastest acceptable result. **PPG** (for Patterned-Pixel-"
"Grouping) is a pixel grouping interpolation that uses assumptions about "
"natural scenery in making estimates. It has fewer color artifacts on natural "
"images than the VNG method. Consider **DCB** and **DHT** interpolation as "

"**Highlights**: Default is here to consider highlights (read: part of your "
"images that are saturated due to the inability of your camera to capture the "
"highlights) as plain / **Solid white**. You can get some fancy results with "
"the unclip option which will paint the highlights in various pinks. Or you "
"can try to recover some parts of the missing information from the highlights "
"with the **Rebuild** option. This is possible because the blue pixels tend "
"to saturate less quickly than the greens and the reds. digiKam will try to "
"reconstruct the missing green and red colors from the remaining non-"
"saturated blue pixels. Of course everything here is a question of a tradeoff "
"between how much color or white you want. If you select **Rebuild** as the "
"option, you will be given the choice to set a **Level**. A value of 3 is a "
"compromise and can/should be adapted on a per image basis. **Unclip** leaves "
