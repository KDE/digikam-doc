"digiKam comes with a nifty batch utility that allows you to convert RAW "
"files to the DNG format. The question is, of course, why you would want to "
"do that. After all, digiKam can handle RAW files without any problem, so "
"what’s the point of adding one more step to your photographic workflow?"

"As you might know, RAW is not a file format, but rather an umbrella term "
"that describes multiple file formats controlled by multiple hardware "
"manufacturers. The RAW formats themselves are specific to digital camera "
"manufacturers. For example, Canon cameras store RAW files in the CR3 format, "
"while Nikon cameras use the NEF format. Besides being proprietary, RAW "
"formats are often poorly documented and encumbered by patents."

"`The Digital Negative (DNG) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Digital_Negative>`_ format introduced by Adobe Systems, Inc in 2004 is "
"designed to overcome these shortcomings by providing an open, well-"
"documented universal format based on TIFF-EP standard for storing RAW files. "
"If you would like to know more about the DNG format, see the :ref:`Digital "
"Asset Management section <dam_fileformats>` from this manual. The `DNG "
"articles and links Web site <http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/>`_ "
"also provides a wealth of valuable information on the topic."

"Being an open and well-documented format, DNG is particularly well suited "
"for long-term archiving of digital photos. Of course, the CR3 and NEF and "
"other RAW formats are widely adopted and supported, so they are not going "
"away anytime soon. But there is no reason why you shouldn’t save your RAW "
"files in the DNG format to be on the safe side. After all, storage is cheap "
"nowadays, and the Batch Queue Manager DNG Converter utility makes it "
"extremely easy to convert RAW files to the DNG format."

msgid ""
"Unlike the :ref:`RAW Converter <raw_converter>` tool which decodes RAW data "
"to an RGB color space, DNG stores the RAW data in an open-standard "
"container. DNG is another RAW format, but it is not proprietary. So you "
"cannot apply Batch Queue Manager filters to DNG images without first "
"converting them to another format such as JPEG, PNG or TIFF. However, the "
"metadata can be post-processed after DNG conversion, as this will maintain "
"the integrity of the RAW image data stored in the container."

"Using the Batch Queue Manager DNG Converter is easy. **Place the tool on the "
"top of workflow list** (this point is mandatory), add the RAW files to the "

"RAW data into the resulting DNG file."

"**JPEG Preview**: with this option you can tune the quality of preview image "

"Size** to store a preview with same dimensions as the original RAW image."
