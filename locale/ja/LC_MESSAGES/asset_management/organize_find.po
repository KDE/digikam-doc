"digiKam provides a number of methods to classify photographs: filenames, "

"if this was not enough, you can search most standard metadata items like "
"camera model, lens, coordinates, image size and many more. The metadata "
"categories listed here are in fact different **views** of your photo "
"library. Combining these views is a very powerful method to narrow down a "
"search to quickly find a file. Imagine having 800 photos of your loved one. "
"Searching for **Salagou**, having more than **3 rating stars**, shot in "
