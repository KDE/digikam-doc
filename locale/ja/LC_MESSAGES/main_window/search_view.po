"Quick Search is the adaptive search box at the top of the search dialog "
"(Left Sidebar) and provides you with a simple means to search the digiKam "
"database with a single query. You can enter any arguments in the **Search** "
"text field and it will be used to determine the results. For instance, you "
"can enter the string \"birthday\" to search the complete database for "
"occurrences of the word \"birthday\" in all metadata text fields, or \"05."
"webp\" to search for a specific image file name \"05.webp\" (no escaping as "

"Thanks to the labeling of the search fields they are pretty much self "

"To explain how it works let's make another example based on one of those we "

"name “Holidays” and color “red”. As we said already this will produce all "
"pictures labeled with “red” out of your whole collection and the content of "

"first field and two stars in the second field. Note that there is a "
"difference between **No star** and **No Rating assigned**! If you want to "
"exclude the pictures without any rating as well you got to open another "

"Which brings us to the fact that you can open as many additional Search "

"Beside the **+ Add Search Group** button you see Reset. This removes all "
"additional Search Groups and clears all the fields in the remaining one. "
"It's a good policy to use this button before starting to create a new "
"search, in particular when you leave the Advanced Search Tool with the "
"intention to use the Quick Search for your next query, because otherwise the "
"search criteria remain active even if you don't see them and screw up your "
"new search. Try carries out the search but leaves the Advanced Search Tool "
"window open, OK does the same but closes the window. **Remove Group** in the "
"header of the additional Search Groups doesn't need an explanation."
