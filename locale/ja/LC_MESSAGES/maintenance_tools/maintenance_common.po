"In the **Common Options** section you can restrict the scope of the "
"maintenance process(es) to certain albums or tags. You can un-check **Whole "
"albums collection** or **Whole tags collection** to get access to the drop "
"down fields where you can select specific albums or tags. Note that a "
"context menu in this drop down field allows you to select or deselect "
"children and/or parents and also to invert the selection. If you switch from "
"**Albums** to **Tags** or vice versa your selection in the now grayed out "
"item will remain untouched which might be useful if you need to reuse a "
"certain selection."
