"The digiKam **Vignetting Correction** tool corrects image vignetting, which "
"is the technical term for under-exposure in the corners."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:96
msgid ""
"Wide angle lenses, especially those used in medium and large format "
"photography, frequently do not uniformly illuminate the entire sensor plane. "
"Instead, they *vignette* (shade) the edges and corners of the image, "
"substantially reducing the light reaching the corners of the sensor. Some "
"telephoto lenses may also suffer from vignetting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:98
msgid ""
"The traditional solution for vignetting is to attach a *center filter* to "
"the lens. This is a neutral density filter with maximum density at the "
"optical axis of the lens, clear at the periphery, with density varying "
"inversely to the vignetting of the lens. A center filter has many "
"advantages: not only does it automatically correct for full-frame images "
"but, since it's fixed to the front of the lens, it also compensates for the "
"off-center vignetting which occurs when camera movements are employed for "
"perspective or plane of focus adjustment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:100
msgid ""
"But there are disadvantages as well. Many center filters require a 1.5 or 2 "
"f-stop filter factor adjustment, which may in turn necessitate a slow "
"shutter speed, especially since wide angle lenses, even with center filters, "
"are best used at apertures of f/16 or smaller. This combination may make the "
"shutter speed slow enough that hand-holding the camera is impossible, and "
"motion blur becomes a problem when photographing moving objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:102
msgid ""
"With the wide exposure range of present-day film and the color (or grey-"
"scale) depth of digital cameras or film scanners, it is possible to simulate "

"Five sliders give you control over the vignetting correction filter, and "
"three more over the target image exposure:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:115
msgid ""
"**Amount**: this option controls the degree of luminosity attenuation by the "
"filter at its point of maximum attenuation. The default amount is 2.0, which "
"corresponds to an optical filter with a 1 f-stop filter factor (equivalent "
"to a factor of 2 reduction in luminosity). Increase the amount to compensate "
"for a greater degree of vignetting; reduce it for less."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:117
msgid ""
"**Feather**: this option determines the rate at which the filter intensity "
"falls off from the point of maximum attenuation toward the edges, expressed "
"as a power factor. The default of 1 yields a linear reduction in filter "
"amount with distance from the center. Power factors greater than 1.0 cause a "
"faster fall-off (for example, a power of 2 causes the amount to decrease as "
"the square of the distance from the center) and causes the effect of the "
"filter to be concentrated near the center. Powers less than 1 spread out the "
"amount of the filter toward the edges; a power of 0.5 causes the amount to "
"fall as the square root of the distance from the center."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:119
msgid ""
"**Radius**: this option specifies the radius, as a multiple of the half "
"diagonal measure of the image, at which the amount of the filter falls off "
"to zero (or, in other words, becomes transparent). The default value of 1.0 "
"specifies a filter which is transparent at its corners. A radius "
"specification greater than 1 extends the effect of the center filter beyond "
"the edges of the image, while a radius less than one limits the filter's "
"action to a region smaller than the image. When compensating for vignetting "
"by lenses used with large format and some medium format cameras, the default "
"radius factor of 1 is rarely correct! These lenses often \"cover\" an image "
"circle substantially larger than the film to permit camera movements "
"relative to the lens to control perspective and focus, and consequently have "
"a vignetting pattern which extends well beyond the edges of the film, "
"requiring a radius setting greater than 1 to simulate a center filter "
"covering the entire image circle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:121
msgid ""
"**X offset** and **Y offset** settings: these options move the center of the "
"filter horizontally or vertically up to the border of the image by the "
"specified percentage. A negative value for the X offset will shift the "
"filter to the left while a positive value will shift it to the right. A "
"negative value for the Y offset will move the filter up, and finally a "
"positive value will move it down."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/enhancement_tools.rst:123
msgid ""
"**Add Vignetting**: many photographs look flat because of a distracting "
"background or another composition matter. While most of time you will want "
"to remove vignetting, it is a fact that selective vignetting can improve the "
"look of a photograph, drawing the eyes to the intended subject. As an artist "
"you may choose this option. Ticking it will invert the filter, thus "
"darkening the corners of a photograph."

"The only way to be sure which settings of **Amount**, **Feather**, and "
"**Radius** best compensate for the actual optical characteristics of a given "
"lens is to expose a uniformly illuminated scene (for example, a grey card "
"lit by diffuse light) and then measure any vignetting in the resulting image "
"(for example with Adjust Level tool histogram position bar). Without such "
"measurements, or specifications by the lens manufacturer giving the precise "
"degree of vignetting at one or more working apertures, you may have to "
"experiment with different settings to find those which work best for each of "
"your lenses. To help you in this task, the tool dialog provides a thumbnail "
"mask rendering applied to the image. Fortunately, the response of the human "
"eye is logarithmic, not linear like most digital imaging sensors, so you "
"needn't precisely compensate for the actual vignetting to create images "
"which viewers will perceive as uniformly illuminated."
