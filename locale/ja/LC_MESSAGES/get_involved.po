"digiKam is a powerful tool with a lot of features but all the different menu "

"specific feature. However maintaining the manual is a big task the digiKam "
"core team can't handle alone..."

"from the work others did on digiKam it is a great (and easy) opportunity to "
"give something back to the project and the community."
