#: ../../image_editor/effects_tools.rst:94
msgid ""
"In the age of chemical image processing, solarizing (also known as Sabatier) "
"was an effect created by exposing a partially developed print to a brief "
"flash of light, then completing the development. The colored, darker areas "
"shield the additional light from the sensitive photo layers, which has the "
"net effect of making the lighter areas darker and inverting the colors. The "
"result resembles a partially negative image."

#: ../../image_editor/effects_tools.rst:96
msgid ""
"The **Level** control helps to preview the solarization by simply increasing "
"it. At about 50% intensity the image shows what was once chemically "

"Velvia is a brand of daylight-balanced color reversal film produced by the "

"The **Lut3D** filter colors images by applying a transformation based on a "

msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/effects_tools.rst:152
msgid ""
"In the film industry, 3D lookup tables are used to map one color space to "
"another. They are commonly used to calculate preview colors for a monitor or "
"digital projector to show how an image will be reproduced on another display "
"device, typically the final digitally projected image or release print of a "
"movie. A 3D LUT is a 3D lattice of output RGB color values that can be "
"indexed by sets of input RGB color values. Each axis of the lattice "
"represents one of the three input color components, so the input color "
"defines a point inside the lattice. Since the point may not be on a lattice "
"point, the lattice values must be interpolated; most products use trilinear "
"interpolation."
