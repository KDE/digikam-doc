"Image metadata is textual information that can be attached to digital images "
"in order to annotate, describe and categorize them. This information is "
"useful for searching and indexing images and for accessibility services. "
"There are three standard formats in which image metadata can be stored: "
"Exif, IPTC and XMP. They concentrate on different properties of the image "
"and are used for different purposes. digiKam provides tools for viewing and "
"editing image metadata in all these formats."

"The application offers metadata editing tools available through the :"
"menuselection:`Item --> Edit Metadata` menu entry. The metadata editor "
"conveniently arranges all metadata into sections for each kind of metadata "
"chunk, making it easier to find and edit specific entries. For example, to "
"edit hardware-related information, switch to the **Device** section. Here "
"you can modify device manufacturer, device model, exposure-related settings, "
"and other information."

"In addition to Exif, IPTC and XMP formats are supported, so you can perform "

"Exif. Remember that Exif is dedicated to store camera information, where "
"IPTC and XMP are more used to store post-process text information such as "
"rights management. So, it is not recommended to edit the metadata injected "
"by the camera that took the photograph; on the other hand, you can add "
"information about the author, copyright, etc. See description of supported "
"text entries in :ref:`DAM Section <authorship_copyright>` of this manual."
