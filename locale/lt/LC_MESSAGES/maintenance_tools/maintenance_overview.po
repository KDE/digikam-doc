"Depending on your workflow, your digiKam settings, and whether you also work "
"on your image collections with other programs, it might be necessary to run "
"maintenance operations from time to time to update the digiKam "

"Duplicate Items** in your collections, **Detect and recognize faces**, or "
"automatically assign quality labels using the **Image Quality Scanner**. The "
"maintenance tool can do all these things, and more. It can even run multiple "
"tools in one go, depending on your requirements."
