"The **Reverse Geocoding** tab uses a public geoname service to look up "
"address details of the geographic position of one or more images, and "
"convert them into tags. Before using reverse geocoding you should be already "
"familiar with the concept of tags and how to create, edit and use them. The "
"best summary of tags is found in the :ref:`Tags View <tags_view>` section of "
"this manual."

"These red tags in curly brackets are called control tags. They determine "
"which address elements you want the reverse geolocation service (based on "
"the **Select Service** option at the top of the sidebar) to look for. You "
"can still delete some of the control tags with the help of the context menu "
"if you feel that you don't need all of them. You can also modify the "
"structure by deleting some control tags and adding them in other places of "
"the tree. You can even build a new tree parallel to the first by adding a "
"control tag to the root tag (here: Location). Arranging the control tags on "
"the same level instead of a tree structure can reduce the number of "
"redundant tags since the same city or town or street name exists in more "
"than one state or country. But it can make the whole location branch of your "
"tag tree quite long and therefore difficult to use. This is to say that you "
"have to find your own solution to this problem depending on your needs. A "
"mixed approach may be best for your applications, but the sooner you find an "
"approach, the less work you have to invest in editing your tag tree and the "
"control tags."
