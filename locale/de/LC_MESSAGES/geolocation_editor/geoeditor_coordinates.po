"be found and fixed iteratively with the displayed map. Move the mouse cursor "
"to the region of interest, zoom in, adjust location, zoom in again, and so "
"on until sufficient accuracy is achieved. Note that the zoom center will "
"always be at the cursor position. Eventually you click with the right mouse "
"button at the desired position and choose **Copy Coordinates**. Now you can "
"go to the list of images below the map, select one or more images, click "
"with the right mouse button on them and choose **Paste Coordinates**. The "

"fields to the right of the map. To save your changes you click the **Apply** "

"To the right of the map there are, beside latitude and longitude, fields for "
"altitude, speed, number of satellites, fix type and uncertainty (DOP). You "
"may see these fields already filled in if you select a photograph where your "
"camera wrote these information into the Exif data. Otherwise you can fill "
"them in manually if you have these data from somewhere else, e.g. a separate "
"GPS receiver. Note that you have to check the relevant checkbox before you "
"can edit a field (under Windows® you may have to double-click it). Only for "
"**Altitude** the context menu on the list of images offers **Look Up Missing "
"Altitude Values** which causes the editor to look up these data in the map "
"data provided the position (latitude and longitude) is already assigned to "
"the photograph."

"GPS track data is invariably recorded in UTC (Universal Time Coordinated), "
"so you need to match the camera time with UTC, which can be done with "
"**Camera Time Zone**. Select **Same As System** if you took the photographs "
"in your home time zone and digiKam will figure out the difference to UTC "
"from your system time. If you took the photographs somewhere else you got to "
"check **Manual** and choose the appropriate difference from the drop-down "
"field to the right. You can use the same mechanism as well to correct a "
"simple mis-adjustment of your camera time for whatever reasons or an offset "
"of a gpx-file due to quirks of a software used to convert other track file "
"formats into gpx. Here comes **Fine offset (mm:ss)** into play where you can "
"add or subtract up to 59 minutes and 59 seconds to your time difference "
"chosen in the field above."

"The **Max. Time Gap (sec.)**: setting specifies the limit within which GPS "
"time and camera time shall be deemed coincident. The maximum value is 2000 "
"seconds. This means that if no entry in the gpx-file matches the time stamp "
"of the photograph exactly, the position of the entry with the smallest time "
"gap to the photograph will become assigned to it as long as this time gap is "
"smaller than the **Max. time gap (sec.)** setting. If you wonder which value "
"you should specify here a look into the settings of your track recording "
"device/software or into the gpx-file (which is easily possible with a text "
"editor) might help. The faster you were moving while taking the "
"photograph(s) the more important this decision will be."

"**Interpolate** offers another option in case there is no exact match "
"between the time stamp of your photograph(s) and an entry in the gpx-file "
"and as long as you were moving more or less straight between two recorded "
"GPS positions it will be the more precise option. Here the position of the "
"photograph is calculated (linear interpolated) from the positions of the two "
"closest entries in the gpx-file and the respective differences in time. If, "
"for instance, the time gaps between the two closest entries and the "
"photograph are equal the position assigned will be on a straight line "
"between the positions of the two entries right in the middle."

"**Max. Interpol. Time Gap (min)**: has nothing to do with policeman Max from "

"If you want to follow this recommendation it is a good idea to change to the "
