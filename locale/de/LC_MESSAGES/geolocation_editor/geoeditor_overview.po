"Geolocation means assigning, editing and using metadata which describe the "
"geographic place where images or videos were taken. The source of these "
"metadata can be your camera, a separate GPS receiver or other means of "
"geographical information, in particular maps."

"Not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an "
"image to a precise geographical location. Not everybody uses an airplane to "
"overfly and scan a certain area with automatic GPS data recording. "
"Environmental planners, military, police, construction bureaus, real estate "
"agencies, all will have an immediate application."

"But if, after some time, one has forgotten where the image was taken, if one "
"loves the nice feature to open with a simple click a browser displaying a "
"zoom of the area, if you like to send your image as a postcard to another "
"digiKam user (who is then able to locate your shot), or if you simply need "
"the documentation aspect of it - having position data stored in a photo is "
"great."

"GPS (global positioning system) is used as a generic term throughout this "
"document. It just means a location in the common spherical coordinate system "
"that can be displayed on a map. The actual technical implementation that "
"provides the data can be the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European "
"GALILEO or any other system."
