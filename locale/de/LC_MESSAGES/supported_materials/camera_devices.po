"RAW file support: if you are using RAW shooting mode with your camera, "
"digiKam is probably well able to deal with it. RAW support depends on the "
"libraw library. To find out if your particular camera is supported, bring up "
"the list from the :menuselection:`Help --> Supported RAW Cameras` menu."

"Current digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact Flash™ "
"Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-link) for data "
"transmission. The actual transfers to a host computer are commonly carried "
"out using the USB Mass Storage device class (so that the camera appears as a "
"disk drive) or using the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its "
"derivatives. Older cameras may use the Serial Port (RS-232) connection."

"digiKam employs the gPhoto program to communicate with digital still "
"cameras. Gphoto is a free, redistributable set of digital camera software "
"applications which supports a growing number of cameras. Gphoto has support "
"for the Picture Transfer Protocol, which is a widely supported protocol "
"developed by the International Imaging Industry Association to allow the "
"transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral "
"devices without the need of additional device drivers."

"Many old digital still cameras used Serial Port to communicate with host "
"computers. Because photographs are big files and serial port transfers are "
"slow, this connection is now obsolete. digiKam supports these cameras and "
"performs image transfers using the gPhoto program. You can find a complete "
"list of supported digital cameras at `this url <http://www.gphoto.org/proj/"

"Gphoto needs to be built with libexif to retrieve thumbnails to digiKam "
"properly. Exif support is required for thumbnail retrieval on some "
"libgphoto2 camera drivers. If Exif support is not set with gPhoto, you might "
"not see thumbnails or the thumbnail extraction may be very slow."
