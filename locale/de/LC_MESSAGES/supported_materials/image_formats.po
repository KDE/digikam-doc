"digiKam relies on a number of libraries and support packages to load and "

"find that a wide range of image formats are viewable within digiKam."

"Image compression is the application of data compression schemes on digital "
"images. It is done through reducing redundancy of the image data in order to "
"be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Image compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression methods are "
"always preferred for their high preservation value for archival purposes "
"before applying transformations like cropping, resizing, color corrections, "
"etc. This is because lossy compression methods, especially when used at low "
"bit rates, introduce compression artifacts. Lossy methods are suitable for "
"natural images such as photos in applications where minor (sometimes "
"imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a substantial "
"reduction in file size. Lossy compression is good for image publishing on "
"the Internet."

msgstr ""

#: ../../supported_materials/image_formats.rst:41
msgid ""
"`Joint Photographic Experts Group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG>`_ is "
"a compressed format that trades some of the image quality to keep file sizes "
"small. In fact, most cameras save their images in this format unless you "
"specify otherwise. A JPEG image is stored using lossy compression, and you "
"can vary the amount of compression. This allows you to choose between lower "
"compression and higher image quality or greater compression and poorer "
"quality. The only reason to choose higher compression is because it creates "
"smaller files so you can store more images, and it's easier to send them by "
"e-mail or post them on the Web. Most cameras give you two or three choices "
"equivalent to good, better, best, although the names vary."

"`JPEG 2000 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000>`_ is an improvement "
"intended to replace the older JPEG by the JPEG committee, introduced in "
"2000. It provides for the same compression ratio with better (smoother) "
"results compared to JPEG. The 2000 version has the option of being lossless "

"`Tagged Image File Format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF>`_ has been "
"widely accepted and widely supported as an image format. Commonly, TIFF may "
"be stored by the camera in uncompressed form or using a lossless compression "
"algorithm (Deflate). It maintains higher image quality but at the expense of "
"much larger file sizes. Some cameras let you save your images in this "
"format, and it is a popular format because of its lossless compression "
"algorithm. The problem is that the format has been altered by so many people "
"that there are now 50 or more flavors and not all are recognizable by "
"programs."

"`Portable Network Graphics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Portable_Network_Graphics>`_ is an image format that was developed as a "
"replacement for a number of older, in the 1990's widely used, image file "
"formats. It is a lossless format like TIFF but it is much more compact and "
"saves disk space. Although your camera is unlikely to support PNG, some "
"people like to convert their photographs to PNG as soon as they get them on "
"their computer. Unlike JPEG, PNG images do not lose quality every time you "
"re-encode them after modification. digiKam fully supports PNG images and the "
"Batch Queue Manager can convert a batch of images from any supported format "
"to PNG (and other formats) in one step."

"PNG is an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed "
"storage of raster images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and "
"can also replace many common uses of TIFF. PNG is designed to work well in "
"on-line viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully "
"streamable with a progressive display option. Also, PNG can store gamma and "
"chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms. "
"PNG supports 8 and 16 bits / colors /pixels depth. It's the perfect file "
"format to archive your photographs."

"`Progressive Graphics File <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Progressive_Graphics_File>`_ is another not so known but open file image "
"format. Wavelet-based, it allows lossless and lossy data compression. PGF "
"compares well with JPEG 2000 but it was developed for speed (compression/"
"decompression) rather than to be the best at compression ratio. At the same "
"file size a PGF file looks significantly better than a JPEG one, while "
"remaining very good at progressive display too. Thus it should be well-"
"suited for photo archiving and **digiKam uses this format in database to "

"covers multimedia files that can also include other media streams, such as "
"timed text, audio and video. HEIF can store images encoded with multiple "
"coding formats, for example both SDR and HDR images. HEVC is an image and "
"video encoding format and the default image codec used with HEIF. HEIF files "
"containing HEVC-encoded images are also known as HEIC files. Such files "
"require less storage space than the equivalent quality JPEG. HEIF support 12 "

"It competes with HEIC, which uses the same container format built upon "
"ISOBMFF, but HEVC for compression. AVIF showed better compression efficiency "

"Some, typically more expensive, cameras allow you to store images in RAW "
"format. RAW format is not really an image standard at all. It is different "
"for every make of camera. RAW format images contain all the data that is "
"taken directly from the camera's image sensor before the software in the "
"camera applies things like white balance, sharpening etc. Storing "
"photographs in a camera's RAW format allows you to alter settings, such as "
"white balance, after the photograph has been taken. Most professional "
"photographers use RAW format, because it offers them maximum flexibility. "
"The downside is that RAW image files can be very large indeed."
