"The left sidebar is the main difference in the Showfoto user interface "
"compared to the digiKam Image Editor. digiKam used the left sidebar to "
"manage many of its advanced Digital Asset Management capabilities, and these "
"capabilities are not supported in Showfoto. ShowFoto does add the "
"**Folders** and **Stack** tabs to the left sidebar giving the user the "
"essential ability to explore, reference, and quickly access image files "
"stored on the computer. All settings adjusted in the left sidebar are saved "
"and restored between Showfoto sessions."
