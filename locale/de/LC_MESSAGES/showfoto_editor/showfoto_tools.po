"Mostly, Showfoto provides the same tools from digiKam Image Editor, in "
"native or as plugins. All :ref:`Colors <colors_tools>`, :ref:`Effects "
"<effects_tools>`, :ref:`Transform <transform_tools>`, :ref:`Decorate "
"<decorate_tools>`, and :ref:`Enhancement <enhancement_tools>` tools are "
"there. Showfoto inherits also of **Raw Import** tool to handle RAW "
"demosaicing operations."

"Even if Showfoto does not provide something like the digiKam **Batch Queue "
"Manager**, it can process files in batch. Plugins as **Time Adjust**, "
"**Print Wizard**, **Metadata Editor**, **HTML Gallery**, etc. are compatible "
"with Showfoto. The main difference to deal with this tools compared to "
"digiKam is the way to pass items to process in the tools. Showfoto does not "
"have an Icon-View as digiKam, but it has the **Stack View** and **Thumbbar** "
"containers. When a :ref:`Post Processing <post_processing>` tool is called "
"from Showfoto, the contents of the Stack or the Thumbbar are loaded in the "
"tool, and of course, you can personalize this list later in the plugin."
