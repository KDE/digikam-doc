"from your camera or scanner have a predictable relationship with the colors "
"you actually photographed or scanned, that the colors displayed on your "
"monitor match the colors coming from your camera or scanner, and that the "
"colors you print or display on the web match the colors you produced in your "

"**Assign** a profile means change the meaning of the RGB numbers in an image "
"by embedding a new profile without changing the actual RGB numbers "

"embed a new profile, but also change the RGB numbers at the same time so "

"On the other hand, every time you assign a new working space profile rather "

"In theory, you should be able to do multiple conversions of an image from "

"**Device-dependent** and **device-independent** profiles: The camera "
"profile, a scanner profile, your monitor's profile, and your printer's color "
"profile are all device-dependent profiles - these profiles only work with "
"the specific device for which they were produced by means of profiling. "
"Working space profiles and the Profile Connection Space are *device-"
"independent*. Once an image file has been translated by Lcms to a device-"
"independent working space, in a sense it no longer matters what device "
"originally produced the image. But as soon as you want to display or print "
"the image, then the device (monitor, printer) used matters a great deal and "
"requires a device-dependent profile."

"An **interpolated RAW file** isn't a RAW file. For some reason this simple "
"point causes a lot of confusion. But after a RAW file has been interpolated "
"by RAW processing software and then output as a TIFF or JPEG, the original "
"RAW file is still a RAW file, of course, but the interpolated file is just "
"an image file. It isn't a RAW file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/basis_knowledge.rst:63

"**Linear** has two related and easily confused definitions. *Linear* can "
"mean that the image tonality reflects the tonality in the original scene as "
"photographed instead of being altered by the application of an S-curve or "
"other means of changing local and global tonality. It can also mean that the "
"gamma transfer curve of the color space is linear. An image can be *linear* "
"in either, both, or neither of these two senses. A RAW image as developed by "
"Libraw is linear in both senses. The same image as developed by Canon's RAW "
"processing software won't be linear in either sense."

"**HDR** and **LDR** do not refer to the bit-depth of the image. **High "
"dynamic range** and **Low dynamic range** refer to the total dynamic range "
"encompassed by an image. A regular low dynamic range image, say encompassing "
"a mere 5 *stops* (the average digital camera these days can easily "
"accommodate 8 or 9 stops), can be saved as an 8-, 16-, 32-, or even 64-bit "
"image, depending on your software, but the dynamic range of the image isn't "
"thereby increased. Only the number of discrete steps from the brightest to "
"the darkest tone in the image has changed. Conversely, a 22-stop scene (way "
"beyond the capacity of a consumer-oriented digital camera without using "
"multiple exposures) can be saved as an 8- or 16-bit image, but the resulting "
"image will exhibit extreme banding (that is, it will display extreme banding "
"in any given tonal range that can actually be displayed on a typical monitor "
"at one time) because of the relatively few available discrete tonal steps "
"from the lightest to the darkest tone in the image."

"**In-camera produced JPEGs don't need a camera profile**: All JPEGs (or "
"TIFFs) coming straight out of a camera (even if produced by point-and-shoots "
"cameras that don't allow you to save a RAW file) start life inside the "
"camera as a RAW file produced by the camera's Analog to Digital converter. "
"If you save your images as JPEGs, then the processor inside the camera "
"interpolates the RAW file, assigns a camera profile, translates the "
"resulting RGB numbers to a working space (usually **sRGB** but sometimes you "
"can choose **AdobeRGB**, depending on the camera), does the JPEG "
"compression, and stores the JPEG file on your camera card. So JPEGs (or "
"TIFFs) from your camera don't need to be assigned a camera profile which is "
"then translated to a working space. JPEGs from a camera are already in a "
"working space."

"**Useful mathematical information**: If you are dealing with Libraw's linear "
"gamma output: Mathematically speaking, when doing a gamma transform you "
"normalize (that is, divide by 256 if you are working with 8-bit values) the "
"RGB numbers and raise the resulting numbers to an appropriate power "
"depending on the respective gammas of the starting and ending color space, "
"then re-normalize the results to a new set of RGB numbers. It's not hard, "
"and very instructive, to do this with a calculator for a few sets of RGB "
"numbers spaced from (0,0,0) to (255,255,255) to see how RGB numbers change "
"from one gamma encoding to another. Lcms does this for you when you ask Lcms "
"to convert from one color space to another."

"As a very important aside, in digiKam the software used to translate from "

"proprietary software that comes with our digital cameras. The Libraw's "
