"Canon for example offers the user several picture styles - neutral, "

"additional control, but still manipulates the RAW image file in accordance "
"with the chosen picture style. Most of the Canon picture styles add a heavy "
"S-curve and extra color saturation to give the picture more *pop*. Even if "
"you choose the *neutral* picture style (the Canon picture style that gives "

"Libraw, which digiKam uses to convert RAW files to image files, doesn't add "

"camera sensor records light linearly, whereas our eyes are constantly "
"interacting with our brain to accommodate dim and bright areas in a scene, "

"The embedded JPEG preview looks so much nicer than Libraw's output, so what "

"has already been done to your image. Once Canon (or Nikon, or Sony, etc.) "
"has applied their proprietary S-curves and shadow de-noising, sharpening, "
"etc. to your image, then your shadows, highlights, edge detail, etc. are "

"You've thrown information away and you cannot get it back, especially in the "

"It seems to me that the heart and soul of image processing is the deliberate "
"manipulation of image tonality, color, selective sharpening, and so forth, "
"so that the viewer focuses in on what you, the photographer, found of "
"particular interest when you took the picture. Why give the art of image "
"processing over to some proprietary RAW processing software? In other words, "
"*flat is the preferred starting point* if you'd rather give your images your "
"own artistic interpretation. The alternative is to let the canned, "
"proprietary algorithms produced by Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc. interpret your "
"images for you. On the other hand, there is no denying that for many images, "
"those canned algorithms are really pretty good."

"You can see the value in starting your image-editing with a scene-referred "

"different. If you asked Libraw to output a 16-bit file and the image looks "

"Digital cameras have an array of millions of little light sensors inside, in "
"the form of either a CCD or a CMOS image sensor. These light-sensing pixels "
"are by construction color-blind - they only record the amount, not the "
"color, of light falling on them. So to allow these pixels to record color "
"information, each pixel is capped by a transparent red, green, or blue lens, "
"usually alternating in what is called a Bayer array (except for Sigma Faveon "
"sensors, which work differently). A RAW image is nothing more than an array "
"of values indicating *how much light* passed through the red, blue, or green "
"lenses to reach the sensor."

"Clearly, pixel response to light is the result of lots of camera specific "
"factors including: the nature of the sensor array itself, the precise "

"*Analog* means continuously varying, like how much water you can put in a "
"glass. *Digitizing* an analog signal means that the continuously changing "
"levels from the analog signal source are *rounded* to discrete quantities "
"convenient to the binary numbers used by computers. The analog to digital "
"conversion that takes place inside the camera is necessary because the light-"
"sensing pixels are analog in nature -- they collect a charge proportionate "
"to the amount of light that reaches them."

#: ../../color_management/camera_profiles.rst:94

"The accumulated charge on each pixel is then turned into a discrete, digital "
"quantity by the camera's analog to digital converter. Which by the way "

"The charge accumulated in each pixel is also subject to a variety of noise "

"on any given pixel by interpolating information gathered from that single "
"pixel plus its neighboring pixels. Every RAW processing program makes "
"additional assumptions such as how much of the measured value is signal and "
"how much is background noise, or at what point has the sensor well reached "
"full saturation. The resulting output of all these algorithms, and the "
