"You are now almost ready to print that image. But where do you get a printer "
"profile? You already know the answer. You can use the generic profile that "
"comes with your printer. You can purchase a professionally produced profile. "
"Some commercial printing establishments will send you their printer profiles "
"(which will with their printers, but not your printer). Or, you can make "
"your own printer profile using `Argyll <http://www.argyllcms.com/>`_, in "
"which case your profile can be tailored to your particular paper, inks, and "
"even image characteristics. For example, if you are printing a series of "
"images with a color palette limited to subdued browns, you don't need a "
"printer profile that tries to make room for saturated cyan and blue."

"Soft-proofing will show you the differences to be expected between what you "

"proof, you need a profile for your printer (actually, for your printer-paper "

"**Perceptual** intent may or may not give the best results with soft-"
"proofing, depending on the respective gamuts of the image and printer/paper "
"combination in question. Usually, the **Colorimetric** intents give clearer, "
"brighter colors, albeit at the cost of having to carefully re-edit the image "
"to avoid clipping highlights and shadows. So while **Perceptual** is always "
"an option, it may not be *the best* option."

"**Perceptual** rendering intent is a safe choice because it prevents "

"proof, probably you should also stick with sRGB)."
