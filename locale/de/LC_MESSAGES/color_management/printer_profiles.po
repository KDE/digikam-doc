"We are now almost ready to print that image. Where to get a printer profile? "
"you already know the answer. You can use the generic profile that comes with "
"your printer. You can purchase a professionally produced profile. Some "
"commercial printing establishments will send you their printer profiles "
"(which won't work with your printer). You can make your own printer profile "
"using `Argyll <http://www.argyllcms.com/>`_, in which case your profile can "
"be tailored to your particular paper, inks, and even image characteristics "
"(if you are printing a series of images with a color palette limited to "
"subdued browns, you don't need a printer profile that tries to make room for "
"saturated cyan and blue)."

msgid ""
"**Rendering intent** refers to the way color gamuts are handled when the "
"intended target color space (for example, the monitor or the printer) cannot "
"handle the full gamut of the source color space (for example the working "
"space)."

msgid "There are four commonly-used rendering intents:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:44
msgid ""
"**Perceptual**, also called **Image or Maintain Full Gamut**. This is "
"generally recommended for photographic images. The color gamut is expanded "
"or compressed when moving between color spaces to maintain consistent "
"overall appearance. Low saturation colors are changed very little. More "
"saturated colors within the gamuts of both spaces may be altered to "
"differentiate them from saturated colors outside the smaller gamut space. "
"Perceptual rendering applies the same gamut compression to all images, even "
"when the image contains no significant out-of-gamut colors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:46
msgid ""
"**Relative Colorimetric**, also called **Proof or Preserve Identical Color "
"and White Point**. Reproduces in-gamut colors exactly and clips out-of-gamut "
"colors to the nearest reproducible hue."
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:48
msgid ""
"**Absolute Colorimetric**, also called **Match or Preserve Identical "
"Colors**. Reproduces in-gamut colors exactly and clips out-of-gamut colors "
"to the nearest reproducible hue, sacrificing saturation and possibly "
"lightness. On tinted papers, whites may be darkened to keep the hue "
"identical to the original. For example, cyan may be added to the white of a "
"cream-colored paper, effectively darkening the image. Rarely of interest to "
"photographers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:50
msgid ""
"**Saturation**, also called **Graphic or Preserve Saturation**. Maps the "
"saturated primary colors in the source to saturated primary colors in the "
"destination, neglecting differences in hue, saturation, or lightness. For "
"block graphics; rarely of interest to photographers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:52
msgid ""
"**Perceptual** and **Relative colorimetric** rendering are probably the most "
"useful conversion types for digital photography. Each places a different "
"priority on how they render colors within the gamut mismatch region. "
"**Relative colorimetric** maintains a near exact relationship between in "
"gamut colors, even if this clips out of gamut colors. In contrast, "
"**Perceptual** rendering tries to also preserve some relationship between "
"out of gamut colors, even if this results in inaccuracies for in gamut "
"colors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:54
msgid ""
"**Absolute** is similar to relative colorimetric in that it preserves in "
"gamut colors and clips those out of gamut, but they differ in how each "
"handles the white point... Relative colorimetric skews the colors within "
"gamut so that the white point of one space aligns with that of the other, "
"while absolute colorimetric preserves colors exactly (without regard to "
"changing white point). **Saturation** rendering intent tries to preserve "
"saturated colors."

"Rendering intents are available when converting from one profile to another "

"Soft-proofing will show you the differences to be expected between what you "

"**Perceptual** intent may or may not give the best results with soft-proof, "
"depending on the respective gamuts of the image and printer/paper "
"combination in question. Usualy, the **Colorimetric** intents give clearer, "
"brighter colors, albeit at the cost of having to carefully re-edit the image "
"to avoid clipping highlights and shadows. **Perceptual** is just an option, "
"not by any means always *the best* option."

"**Perceptual** rendering intent is a safe choice because it prevents "
