"sRGB is widely accepted as a standard color profile by virtually everyone "

"Hewlett Packard and Microsoft as a standardized color space for consumer-"
"oriented applications. As stated in the initial proposal:"

"Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft propose the addition of support for a standard "
"color space, sRGB, within the Microsoft operating systems, HP products, the "
"Internet, and all other interested vendors. The aim of this color space is "
"to complement the current color management strategies by enabling a third "
"method of handling color in the operating systems, device drivers and the "
"Internet that utilizes a simple and robust device independent color "
"definition. This will provide good quality and backward compatibility with "
"minimum transmission and system overhead. Based on a calibrated colorimetric "
"RGB color space well suited to Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors, television, "
"scanners, digital cameras, and printing systems, such a space can be "
"supported with minimum cost to software and hardware vendors."

"Currently, the ICC (International Color Consortium) tracks and ensures that "
"a color is correctly mapped from the input to the output color space. By "
"attaching a profile for the input color space to the image in question. This "
"is appropriate for high end users. However, there are a broad range of users "
"that do not require this level of flexibility and control. Additionally, "
"most existing file formats do not, and may never support color profile "
"embedding, and finally, there are a broad range of uses [that] actually "
"discourage people from appending any extra data to their files. A common "
"standard RGB color space addresses these issues by merging the many standard "
"and non-standard RGB monitor spaces into a single standard RGB color space. "
"Such a standard could dramatically improve the color fidelity in the desktop "
"environment. For example, if operating system vendors provide support for a "
"standard RGB color space, the input and output device vendors that support "
"this standard color space could easily and confidently communicate color "
"without further color management overhead in the most common situations."

"To summarize, the point of the by-now almost universally adopted sRGB color "
"space was and is to make life easier for consumers (no need to worry about "
"color management), less expensive for manufacturers (no need to worry about "
"compatibility between consumer-level digital cameras or scanners, monitors, "

"If you choose to work exclusively in the sRGB color space, do you need to "
"calibrate your monitor? Whether you stay within the color gamut provided by "
"sRGB or not, you need a properly calibrated monitor because sRGB assumes "
"that your monitor is calibrated to sRGB. Your monitor calibration closes the "
"loop. If you work within the color gamut provided by sRGB then you need to "
"calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard (or produce and use an accurate "
"monitor profile, or both). What are the consequences of working with an "
"uncalibrated monitor?"
msgstr ""

"There are several possible consequences, none of them good. Every monitor, "
"calibrated or otherwise, has a native (uncalibrated) white point, expressed "
"as a temperature in degrees Kelvin. The white point of a monitor (calibrated "
"or not) is the color you see when you are looking at a patch of pure white "
"on your screen. Pure white is when the RGB values in your image all equal "
"255 (as expressed in 8-bits), such as the plain white background of a web "
"page or an office document. You are thinking, *white is white* but if you "
"were able to line up several monitors calibrated to different white points, "
"you would see that the higher the temperature of the monitor's white point, "
"the bluer the screen looks in comparison with monitors with lower white "
"points."

"If you can find the controls of your own monitor, change the temperature up "
"and down (remembering to put it back to its initial setting when you are "
"done, unless you decide you want a different white point). Your eyes, which "
"adapt quickly to a constant white point, will easily discern the screen "
"getting bluer and yellower as you move the white point higher and lower. If "
"your uncalibrated monitor is too blue (native CRT color temperature is "
"typically 9300K and sRGB assumes 6500K), as you edit your image you will "
"overcompensate and produce images that will look yellowish and too warm on a "
"properly calibrated monitor. Conversely, if your monitor is too yellow "
"because the color temperature is set too low (LCD native color temperature "
"is around 5500K), your images will look blueish/too cool on a properly "
"calibrated monitor."

"Setting a proper white point is only part of monitor calibration. You also "

"If your monitor gamma is improperly set, your tonal variations from dark to "
"light will be off. That is, the shadows or highlights might be overly "
"compressed or expanded, leading you to compensate in the opposite direction. "
"So when viewed on a properly calibrated monitor, the shadows might be too "
"bright or dark (or the highlights too dark or bright), with the rest of the "
"image suffering from tonal over-compression. And heaven help you if the "
"internal R, G, and B guns (or LCD equivalent) of your monitor are improperly "
"set (each gun has its own black point and gain), because the resulting color "
"casts - too green, too magenta, too orange, etc. that you will inevitably "

"the same image as displayed by other monitors in your house or on your "
"friend's and neighbor's monitors. Every image edited on either monitor "
"looked very wrong on the other monitor, until we purchased a "
"spectrophotometer to calibrate and profile both monitors. Unfortunately, at "
"this point neither of these two monitors can be calibrated to display a "
"proper black point, so they are no longer used for image editing - the point "

"The meaning of **black point** and **brightness** seems pretty clear, but "
"what does **gamma** mean? **Gamma compression**, also known as gamma "
"encoding, is used to encode **linear luminance** or RGB values into video "

"decoding, process."

"Gamma encoding helps to map data (both analog and digital) into a more "
"perceptually uniform domain. If you wade very deeply into image editing and "
"color management, eventually you will need to make decisions about what "
"gamma (or other encoding/decoding function) you want to use when you "
"calibrate your monitor, profile your digital camera, and choose a working "
"color space. When in doubt (for those of you who just want to know which "
"button to push), gamma=2.2 is a widely-used value, both for monitor "
"calibration and working color spaces."

"What's the difference between calibrating a monitor and profiling a monitor? "
"When first learning about color management, many people are confused about "
"the difference between calibrating and profiling a monitor. Calibration is a "
"process where a device is brought into some defined state by making "
"adjustments to its controls or some other physical means. For example, the "
"act of calibrating a monitor involves adjusting its **white point**, **black "
"level**, **luminosity** and **gamma** to predetermined or standard values "
"using the monitor's controls and by altering the video card gamma ramp."
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/monitor_profiles.rst:71
msgid ""
"In contrast to calibration, the process of creating a profile is a "
"characterization of the device that does not involve making any changes or "
"adjustments to the device. Rather it is a measurement process that results "
"in a file that contains a precise mathematical description of the device's "
"color and tonality characteristics. This file is an **ICC profile**. These "
"characteristics include the transfer function from the device's color space "
"to a standardized absolute color space (this is called a Profile Color Space "
"in an ICC profile), the device's **white point**, **black point**, "
"**primaries** and other information. Displays are normally characterized "
"(profiled) in their calibrated state."

"To summarize, calibration makes changes to the device to alter it's color "
"reproduction characteristics to conform to some predetermined state. "
"Profiling or characterization is a measurement process that results in a "

"reproduction characteristics."

"Calibrating your monitor technically is not really part of color management. "
"But obviously a properly calibrated and/or profiled monitor is a "
"prerequisite for a color-managed workflow. This manual does not cover the "
"important topics of how to calibrate and profile a monitor. The `Argyll "
"<http://www.argyllcms.com/>`_ documentations are very good and highly "
"recommended reading. To use either of this software to calibrate and/or "
"profile your monitor, you will need a spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer "
"(sometimes called a *spider*) is a device for measuring the RGB values of "
"color patches projected onto the monitor screen by calibration/profiling "
"software such as Argyll. The Argyll website maintains an up-to-date list of "

"There are various methods given on the Internet for calibrating a monitor "
"without using a spectrophotometer. These *eye-ball* methods are better than "
"not calibrating your monitor at all, and depending your eyeball and your "
"monitor, can produce quite usable results. But the eye-ball methods are not "
"a substitute for a properly calibrated and profiled monitor. For the record, "
"calibrating and profiling a monitor with a spectrophotometer, though "
"intimidating at first, is not difficult. Spectrophotometers can be obtained "
"for well under 100€ (if you opt for a more expensive model, make sure you "
