"digiKam is color-management enabled application. RAW files coming straight "
"out of a camera without having the benefit of any color processing. Your "
"camera provides the data it has captured in a raw format, and lets you "
"manage all the processing. Every camera has unique aspects about how it "
"captures color information, therefore you will need to apply a camera-"
"specific profile to the images you want to process. Please refer to the :ref:"
"`ICC color profile management <color_management>` section of this manual for "

"images, you may want to opt for Adobe RGB. If your images are only for "
"display on the web, sRGB is a better choice. (Adobe RGB will be displayed "
"slightly dull in non-color managed enabled software such as browsers.) "
"However, you can change this profile at any time by selecting another "
"profile, therefore Adobe RGB can be a good choice for storing and image "
"handling as you can always change it to sRGB before releasing an image for "
"your blog. Note: Do not use non-linear profiles as they will change the "

"**Perceptual**: causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or "

"is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, "
"if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the "
"output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the "
"image to be adjusted so that every color in the image falls within the range "
"that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is "
"preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of "
"photographs and images, and is the default intent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../setup_application/cm_settings.rst:102
msgid ""
"**Relative Colorimetric**: is defined such that any colors that fall outside "
"the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest "
"color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This "
"intent does not preserve the white point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../setup_application/cm_settings.rst:104
msgid ""
"**Absolute Colorimetric**: causes any colors that fall outside the range "
"that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that "
"can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent "
"preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, "
"TruMatch, logo colors, etc.)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../setup_application/cm_settings.rst:106
msgid ""
"**Saturation**: preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the "
"possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains "
"somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the "
"desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as "
"charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and of "
"sufficient contrast with respect to each other, rather than matching "
"specific colors."
