"digiKam is color-management enabled application. RAW files - as they come - "
"are not color managed at all. Your camera provides the data it has captured "
"in a raw format and will let you manage all the processing. Every camera has "
"its specifics as to how it captures color information, therefore you will "
"need to apply a specific profile to the images you want to process. Please "
"refer to the section :ref:`ICC color profile management <color_management>` "
"for more details an explanations."

"Basically, a profile *maps* the color information and gives information on "

"You have to provide a **Working Color Space** profile (linear profiles such "

"publishing, sRGB is better (Adobe RGB will be displayed slightly dull in non "
"color managed enabled software such as browsers). However you may change "
"this later of course (by attributing another profile), therefore Adobe RGB "
"can be a good choice for storing and image handling as you can always change "
"it to sRGB before releasing an image for your blog. Note: Do not use non-"

"**Perceptual**: causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or "

"is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, "
"if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the "
"output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the "
"image to be adjusted so that the every color in the image falls within the "
"range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is "
"preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of "
"photographs and images, and is the default intent."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Relative Colorimetric**: is defined such that any colors that fall outside "
"the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest "
"color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof "
"intent does not preserve the white point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../setup_application/cm_settings.rst:100
msgid ""
"**Absolute Colorimetric**: causes any colors that fall outside the range "
"that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that "
"can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent "
"preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, "
"TruMatch, logo colors, etc.)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../setup_application/cm_settings.rst:102
msgid ""
"**Saturation**: preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the "
"possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains "
"somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the "
"desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as "
"charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast "
"well with each other rather than a specific color."
