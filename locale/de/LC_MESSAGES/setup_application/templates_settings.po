"The goal of templates is to apply more than one metadata information at the "
"same time to items. You can create many profiles corresponding to your "
"workflow. In all cases, the information will be hosted in file to XMP "
"metadata, and for some fields, in IPTC when possible. Remember that XMP is a "
"replacement of IPTC as explained :ref:`in this section <iptc_tags>` of the "
"manual."

"To create a new template you type a title in the input field and click the "
"**Add** button. The new template will appear in the list. To edit an "
"existing template you select it in the list, then you edit its fields (see "

"**Authors** (synonymous to *Creator and By-line*): This field should contain "

"not appropriate to add the name of the photographer (for example, if the "
"identity of the photographer needs to be protected) the name of a company or "
"organization can also be used. Once saved, this field should not be changed "

"**Author Positions** (synonymous with *By-line title*): This field should "

"Commercial Photographer. Since this is a qualifier for the Author field, the "
"Author field must also be filled out. With IPTC, this field is limited to 32 "

"**Credit** (synonymous with *Provider*): Use the credit field to identify "

"author. If a photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or "
"the Associated Press, these organizations could be listed here as they are "
"\"providing\" the image for use by others. If the image is a stock "

"**Copyright**: The Copyright Notice should contain any necessary copyright "
"notice for claiming the intellectual property, and should identify the "
"current owner(s) of the copyright for the photograph. Usually, this would be "
"the photographer, but if the image was done by an employee or as work-for-"
"hire, then the agency or company should be listed. Use the form appropriate "
"to your country. For the United States you would typically follow the form "
"of (c) {date of first publication} name of copyright owner, as in *(c) 2005 "
"John Doe.* Note, the word *copyright* or the abbreviation *copr* may be used "
"in place of the (c) symbol. In some foreign countries only the copyright "
"symbol is recognized and the abbreviation does not work. Furthermore the "
"copyright symbol must be a full circle with a *c* inside; using something "
"like (c) where the parentheses form a partial circle is not sufficient. For "
"additional protection worldwide, use of the phrase, \"all rights reserved\" "
"following the notice above is encouraged. In Europe you would use: Copyright "
"{Year} {Copyright owner}, all rights reserved. In Japan, for maximum "
"protection, the following three items should appear in the copyright field "
"of the IPTC Core: (a) the word, Copyright; (b) year of the first "
"publication; and (c) name of the author. You may also wish to include the "
"phrase *all rights reserved*. With XMP, you can include more than one "
"copyright string using different languages. With IPTC, this field is limited "

"**Source**: The Source field should be used to identify the original owner "

"While not yet enforced by the custom panels, you should consider this to be "
"a \"write-once\" field. The source could be an individual, an agency, or a "
"member of an agency. To aid in later searches, it is suggested to separate "
"any slashes */* with a blank space. Use the form *photographer / agency* "
"rather than *photographer/agency*. Source may also be different from Creator "

"**Use custom definition** section. If you don't know the code for the "
"subject you want to assign this way is a bit tedious since there are 1400 "
"subjects in the standard. A better way is to look for your subject in this "
"URL. There you select **Subject Codes** and your language (English "

"In general the IPTC Subject Codes are quite comprehensive but on the other "

"you find just Go, Chess, Bridge and Shogi. So you may want to add own "
"subjects, even though they always remain private (or company) subjects. A "
"way to do that in digiKam is to first check **Use standard reference code** "
"and select *10001004* which brings you to *Lifestyle* and *Leisure/Games/"
"shogi* - just to stay in our example. Then you check **Use custom "
"definition** and change the last digit of **Reference** to 5 and the text in "
"the **Detail**” field to - say *domino*. You save this custom definition to "
"the template by clicking **Add** button at the right side of the subjects "
"list. Then you type in a template title (if it's a new template) and save "
"the template by clicking **Add** button at the right side of the templates "
"list. Don't mix up these two."
