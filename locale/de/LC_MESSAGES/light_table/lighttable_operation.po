"With the By Pair mode turned off, any two images can be compared by dragging "
"the first image from the thumb bar to the left comparison pane, and then the "
"second image to the right comparison pane. A little arrow will indicate "
"which copy is shown in which pane. The current selected pane will be "
"highlighted by a frame. If the two images have the same aspect ratio and you "
"choose **Synchronize** from the toolbar, any zoom and panning in one window "
"will be synchronously executed in the other pane. This allows you to easily "
"compare the same areas in the two images."

"The By Pair mode is better suited for quickly culling from a series of "
"images. If you choose **By Pair** from the toolbar, the two sequential "
"images from the thumbbar will be automatically inserted into the comparison "
"panes. Click on any thumbnail to make it the left side preview, the adjacent "
"thumbnail to the right will be inserted into the right pane. That makes it "
"easy to sift through a series of similar images. And this sifting can be "
"done with or without the Synchronized mode."
