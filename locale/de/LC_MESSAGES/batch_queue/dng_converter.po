"digiKam comes with a nifty batch utility that allows you to convert RAW "
"files to the DNG format. The question is, of course, why you would want to "
"do that. After all, digiKam can handle RAW files without any problem, so "
"what’s the point of adding one more step to your photographic workflow?"

"As you might know, RAW is not a file format, but rather an umbrella term "
"that describes multiple file formats controlled by multiple hardware "
"manufacturers. The RAW formats themselves are specific to digital camera "
"manufacturers. For example, Canon cameras store RAW files in the CR3 format, "
"while Nikon cameras use the NEF format. Besides being proprietary, RAW "
"formats are often poorly documented and encumbered by patents."

"`The Digital Negative (DNG) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Digital_Negative>`_ format introduced by Adobe Systems, Inc in 2004 is "
"designed to overcome these shortcomings by providing an open, well-"
"documented universal format based on TIFF-EP standard for storing RAW files. "
"If you would like to know more about the DNG format, see the :ref:`Digital "
"Asset Management section <dam_fileformats>` from this manual. The `DNG "
"articles and links Web site <http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/>`_ "
"provides also a wealth of valuable information on the topic."

"Being an open and well-documented format, DNG is suited particularly well "
"for long-term archiving of digital photos. Of course, the CR3 and NEF and "
"other RAW formats are widely adopted and supported, so they are not going "
"away anytime soon. But there is no reason why you shouldn’t save your RAW "
"files in the DNG format to be on the safe side. After all, storage is cheap "
"nowadays, and the Batch Queue Manager DNG Converter utility makes it "
"supremely easy to convert RAW files to the DNG format."

"Unlike the :ref:`RAW Converter <raw_converter>` tool which decodes RAW data "
"to RGB color space, DNG takes the RAW data to store in a open-standard "
"container. DNG is another RAW format (not proprietary). You cannot process "
"RGB information over the images with Batch Queue Manager filters without of "
"decode the image and store the result in another format as JPEG, PNG or "
"TIFF. However, the metadata can be post-processed after DNG conversion, as "
"this will not touch the RAW image data from the container."
