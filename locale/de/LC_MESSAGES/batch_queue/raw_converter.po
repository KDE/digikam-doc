"There are some things to be considered before you process, or even shoot in "
"RAW format. Uncompressed RAW image file formats store all of the information "
"obtained by the camera for each image. There are also some compressed RAW "
"formats that store the same information after application of reversible, "
"lossless compression algorithms. Many photographers prefer to take pictures "
"in RAW mode because digital image post-processing can often produce better "
"quality images than the camera's built-in conversion algorithms."

"The RAW files include data from each physical pixel in the camera's focal "
"plane. For most digital cameras this means recording four color channels for "
"each color pixel in the final image: one red, one blue, and two green "
"channels. Often these channels are recorded to a bit depth greater than the "
"8 bits used in most common image formats. And the white balance of the "
"digital camera is stored in a RAW image, so it can be applied to the image "
"in post-processing. Demosaicing is the step taken to convert this raw 4-"
"channel data to the standard 3-channel RGB representation used in standard "
"image formats like JPEG and TIFF. That is the job of the RAW Convertor tool."

"The RAW conversion in digiKam is based on `Libraw <https://www.libraw.org/"

"Next adjust the available check and value boxes to optimize the RAW "
"conversion process in the Batch Queue Manager settings view. Settings are "
"available to adjust demosaicing and white balance, apply noise reduction, or "
"manage the color profile. If find the results of a RAW conversion are not "
"quite optimal, don't worry, it is always possible to fine-tune the image "
"later on. A detailed description of the **RAW Decoding** settings is "
"provided in :ref:`this section <setup_rawdefault>` of this manual."

"For RAW files, you must choose one output format to save the conversion "
"result by adding a   format conversion tool to the end of Assigned Tools "
"list. The file name will stay the same by default, only the extension "
"changes. **JPEG** uses a lossy algorithm that often produces the smallest "
"output file size. In contrast, the tagged image format (**TIFF**) preserves "
"all image information using a lossless LZW compression."

"Don't use the **JPEG** format if you intend to perform a lot of editing on "
"your images or if it is likely that you have to later reuse the images. The "
"**JPEG** format allows only a limited number of operations before image "
"quality visibly deteriorates. **TIFF** and **PNG** are better suited to "
"maintain the quality of the original data."
