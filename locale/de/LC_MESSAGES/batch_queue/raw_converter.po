"There are ome considerations before your convert, and even before you shoot "
"in RAW format. RAW image file formats keep the original information of the "
"exposure supposedly without loss (when compressed, they use reversible, "
"lossless compressions algorithms). Many photographers prefer to take their "
"picture in RAW mode because the camera's built-in conversion program is "
"often of lesser quality than what you can achieve with digital image "
"processing. The whitebalance of the digital camera is registered but not "
"applied to the image. Some CMOS CCD's create four types of color filter "
"data: RGBG, Red, Green, Blue and another Green mask for contrast "
"enhancement. This tool can take this into account."

"The conversion is based on `Libraw <https://www.libraw.org/>`_. Don't expect "
"to produce the same images as software provided by the camera vendor but "
"sometimes libraw gives better results. See :ref:`this section "
"<camera_profiles>` of this manual for details."

"In Batch Queue Manager settings view, you can adjust the available check and "
"value boxes to optimize the RAW conversion process. The first checkbox "
"indicates to use the camera settings for white balance. The essential "
"parameters like brightness, and red/blue amplifier may be adjusted. If the "
"result is not quite optimal, don't worry, it is always possible to fine-tune "
"the image later on."

"The **Interpolate RGB as four colors** conversion option can be selected to "
"use contrast information. (If your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG "
"setting has no effect). If you want to know all details about the **RAW "
"Decoding** settings see :ref:`this section <setup_rawdefault>` of this "

"You must choose one output formats to save the conversion result by placing "
"the target file format conversion tool. The file name will stay the same by "
"default, only the extension changes. **JPEG** uses the lossy algorithm and "
"produces the smallest output file size. In opposite the tagged image format "
"(**TIFF**) preserves all information of your image while using lossless LZW "
"compression."

"If you intend to work a lot on your images or if it is likely that you have "
"to reuse it later on, then don't use **JPEG** format because it allows a "
"limited number of operations before it deteriorates visibly. **TIFF** and "
"**PNG** are better suited to keep the original data."
