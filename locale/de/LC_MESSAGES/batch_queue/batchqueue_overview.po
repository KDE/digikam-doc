"digiKam features a batch queue manager that opens in a separate window to "
"easily batch process a list of items, aka filtering, converting, "
"transforming, etc. Batch processing works with all supported image formats "
"including RAW files."

"To select images for batch processing, select one or several images in any "
"view from the main window, then select **Add to Current Queue** :kbd:`Ctrl"
"+B` from the context menu. The selection will be added to the batch queue, "
"and a separate Batch Queue Manager window will open. You can also quickly "
"open the Batch Queue Manager window from the digiKam **Main Window** by "
"selecting :menuselection:`Tools --> Batch Queue Manager` :kbd:`B`, or by "
"clicking **Batch Queue Manager** in the main toolbar."

"The Batch Queue Manager window displays the list of **Queues** to process on "
"the top left. Queues are a stack of items to batch process, applying the "
"same tools with the same settings to each image in the queue. Each queue is "
"processed sequentially, but queue contents can be processed in parallel, "
"depending on the Queue Settings. The Queue list shows queues as tabs, with "
"each tab listing the items in that queue as an ordered table displaying the "
"item thumbnail, the original filename, and the target filename indicating "
"where the result should be stored."

"The list of **Assigned Tools** to apply to each item in the queue is shown "

"new format at the end of this list in order to preserve the best image "
"quality."
