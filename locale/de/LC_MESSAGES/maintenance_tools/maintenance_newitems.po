"To be precise, this option will force digiKam to scan all collections for "
"new items to register new elements in database. The scan is performed in the "
"background through the progress manager available in the status-bar when "
"digiKam main interface is loaded. If your computer is fast enough, this will "
"have no effect on usability of digiKam while scanning. If your collections "
"are huge or if you use a remote database, this can introduce low latency, "
"and it is recommended to disable this option and to plan a manual scan "
"through the maintenance tool at the right moment."

"Another option from this setup panel named **Fast scan (detects new, deleted "

"that have been changed, this option must be deactivated."

"To identify files quickly and register items changes in database while "
"scanning, digiKam uses a hash. This is not a full hash of the file for "
"performance reasons, but it's reliable enough. The file size is therefore "
"included. digiKam uses these parameters to try to find files again during a "
"scan if they have been moved or renamed externally. To have a scan process "
"the most efficient, we recommend doing file operations within digiKam, not "
"by an external application as a file manager."
