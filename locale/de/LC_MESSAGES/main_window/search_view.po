"Quick Search is the adaptive search box at the top of the search dialog "
"(Left Sidebar) and provides you with a simple means to search the digiKam "
"database with a single query. You can enter any arguments in the **Search** "
"text field and it will be used to determine the results. For instance, you "
"can enter the string \"birthday\" to search the complete database for "
"occurrences of the word \"birthday\" in all metadata text fields, or \"05."
"webp\" to search for a specific image file name \"05.webp\" (no escaping as "

"Click on one of the blue categories and there will fold out an area with all "

"of data each field contains different input fields for your search, "
"sometimes more than one type for the same field. Simplest are selection "
"buttons, e.g. for colors. Then you have plain fields of the “The field "
"content contains type\", drop down lists and checkboxes. Many fields have "
"two input fields allowing you to define a range, e.g. **Find items with a "
"width between**. And often you find a link type thing called \"Any\" which "

"Thanks to the labeling of the search fields they are pretty much self "
"explaining. What we have to talk about is how they work together if you fill "
"in or select more than one. On the right side of the header (blue area at "

"Complicated? No, good! Because the real stuff is yet to come. Have a look at "

"Group**. If you hit this button another list with the same categories of "
"search fields will open below the first one (scroll down in case you don't "
"see it right away) separated by a blue header showing the same options we "

"To explain how it works let's make another example based on one of those we "
"had already. I want to use the second one. That means: in the first group "
"you checked **Meet Any of the following conditions** and you selected Album "
"name “Holidays” and color “red”. As we said already this will produce all "
"pictures labeled with “red” out of your whole collection and the content of "
"the Album “Holidays”. Now let's assume for some reason you want to exclude "
"all rejected files and all files with a rating lower than three stars."

"So you open a second group, click on the underlined OR in the header in "
"order to change it to AND, select **None of these conditions are met**, fold "
"out the **Picture Properties**, check under **Labels** the red flag "
"(rejected) and select under **Rating** no star (five white stars) in the "
"first field and two stars in the second field. Note that there is a "
"difference between **No star** and **No Rating assigned**! If you want to "
"exclude the pictures without any rating as well you got to open another "
"Search Group, click on the underlined OR in the header in order to change it "
"to AND, select **None of these conditions are met** and select **No Rating "
"assigned** in the **Picture Properties** category."

"Which brings us to the fact that you can open as many additional Search "
"Groups as you need to formulate your query. But since the purpose of this "
"handbook is not to open a competition in creating the most sophisticated "
"queries I leave it to you to figure out how far you have to go or can go in "
"this respect and rather finish this section with a few hints about the other "
"buttons in the Advanced Search Tool."

"Beside the **+ Add Search Group** button you see Reset. This removes all "
"additional Search Groups and clears all the fields in the remaining one. "
"It's a good policy to use this button before starting to create a new "
"search, in particular when you leave the Advanced Search Tool with the "
"intention to use the Quick Search for your next query, because otherwise the "
"search criteria remain active even if you don't see them and screw up your "
"new search. Try carries out the search but leaves the Advanced Search Tool "
"window open, OK does the same but closes the window. **Remove Group** in the "
"header of the additional Search Groups doesn't need an explanation."
