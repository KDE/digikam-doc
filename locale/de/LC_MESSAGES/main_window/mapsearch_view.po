"The earth view is a topographical map of our beautiful home planet. To allow "
"for better orientation the map offers a scale bar in the lower left corner "
"as well as a windrose on the top right. To navigate and to control the view "
"you can use the tools on the Navigation info box at the right: Press the "
"arrow buttons to rotate the globe. The Up and Down arrow buttons will tilt "
"the earth axis back and forth. The Left and Right arrow buttons will make "
"the earth spin around its physical axis."

"You can accomplish the same behavior by pressing the left mouse button "

"button pressed. Using this drag and drop style navigation will allow you to "

"your keyboard offer another alternative way to quickly change directions."

"Now let's have a look on the three buttons at the right end of the row right "
"under the map. They control which images you see in the Image Area out of "
"your defined region. Let's begin with the one at the very end of the row, "
"the Select-images button. If you activate it, it will toggle the selection "
"of a photograph (or a group of photographs if they are hidden behind each "
"other) once you click on it on the map. This can be helpful to fine tune "
"your selection before carrying out operations from the Right Sidebar or the "
"menus."
