"digiKam's main window has two areas in the center showing your photographs. "
"One is the **Icon Area**, showing thumbnails of the content of the selected "
"album or of a search result, and the other one the **Preview**, showing the "
"selected image. Together let's call them the :ref:`Image Area <image_view>`. "
"In the top left corner of the preview we have a few buttons for moving back "
"and forth through the content of the album, for rotating the image, for "
"showing or adding face tags and to switch to full screen mode. By clicking "
"on the preview you can make it disappear and by clicking on the picture area "
"of a thumbnail open it again."

"`Main Toolbar <main_toolbar>` at the top, the :ref:`Status Bar <status_bar>` "

"Left Sidebar lets you switch between nine “Views”: Albums (shown here), "
"Tags, Labels, Dates, Timeline, Search, Fuzzy (Search), Map and People "
"(Tags). The Right Sidebar can be used to show all information about your "
"images and partly also to edit them. You can use all these views to organize "
"and find your photographs. If you click on one of the buttons on the "
"sidebars there will fold out another area, offering possibilities to select, "
"to make inputs, e.g. for searches, to edit data and to show information."
