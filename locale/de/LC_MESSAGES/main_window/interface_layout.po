"digiKam's main window has two areas in the center showing your photographs. "
"One is the **Icon Area ③**, showing thumbnails of the content of the "
"selected album or of a search result, and the other one the **Preview Area "
"④**, showing the selected image. Together let's call them the :ref:`Image "
"Area <image_view>` ⑤. In the top left corner of the preview we have a few "
"buttons ⑨ for moving back and forth through the content of the album, for "
"rotating the image, for showing or adding face tags and to switch to full "
"screen mode. Clicking on the preview makes the preview disappear, and "
"clicking on the picture area of a thumbnail makes the preview appear again."
