"The Timeline View shows a timescale-adjustable histogram of the numbers of "
"images per time unit which is selectable by a drop down field. To the right "
"of that you can choose between a linear or logarithmic histogram. A "
"selection frame moves over the histogram. To display the photographs out of "
"a certain time frame just click on the corresponding bar. You are not "
"restricted to one bar. With :kbd:`Shift+left` click or :kbd:`Ctrl+left` "
"click you can add more bars to the first one."

"In the field right below you can enter a title and save your selection. It "
"will then appear in the **Searches** list field below. But the best is still "
"to come: the Timeline View offers a search for a search! If you have a lot "
"more searches saved than my ridiculous four in the screenshot the adaptive "
"search field at the bottom may help to find a certain search."
