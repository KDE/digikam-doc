"Before you can have digiKam finding duplicates the signatures (or "
"fingerprints) have to be calculated. You can start that process with the "
"button **Update Fingerprints** which initiates a total rebuild of the image "
"signatures (may take hours if you have a large collection and slow storage "
"devices). If you have already scanned your images for fingerprints then you "
"should skip this step."

"You can perform fingerprint operations using :menuselection:`Tools --> "

"Once the fingerprints are calculated you can use **Find Duplicates**, but it "
"will take a long time too as it has to compare every image with any other "
"image. So the way to go in both cases is to confine your search to certain "
"**Albums** and/or **Tags**. **Whole albums collection** and **Whole tags "
"collection** check-box perform global searches in the database. Else uses "
