"As long as you are not just taking pictures from machines or stars or "
"something like that, Face Management might be an interesting feature for you "
"(even with a machine there might be a human being operating it). In digiKam "

"The face management workflow allows you to detect and recognize people in "
"your photographs. Both features use a deep learning neural network in "
"background. **Face Detection** allows digiKam to detect faces in your "
"images. This step is required before being able to recognize faces. **Face "

"needs few items already trained for a same face name to be able to recognize "
"new ones."
