Tags (also called *keywords* in other applications) are labels that can be applied to individual images or groups of images. Once a tag has been applied to an image the image can be found again by selecting the tag or doing a search."

msgid "In this tag tree the keyword *Cat* appears three times. This will not cause a problem within digiKam, but there are quite a few views where the user cannot know which of the three is applied to an image because they might not be able to see the whole tag hierarchy. In a case like this, also tagging the image with the parent tag or even the whole hierarchy often becomes quite unwieldy, particularly in the display of image tags within the image icon. The second *Cat* could be avoided by calling it *Wild Cat*, but calling the third one *Zoo Cat* seems a bit excessive, I think. And there would still be two *Cheetah*!"
