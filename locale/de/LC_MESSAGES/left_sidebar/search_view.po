"Quick Search is the adaptive search box at the top of the search dialog "
"(Left Sidebar) that provides you with a simple means to search the digiKam "
"database with a single query. Any arguments entered into the **Search** text "
"field will be used to determine the results. For instance, you can enter the "
"string \"birthday\" to search the complete database for occurrences of the "
"word \"birthday\" in all metadata text fields, or \"05.webp\" to search for "
"a specific image file name \"05.webp\" (no escaping as in reg-expressions "

"We'll use another example to illustrate how this works. Assume that in the "
