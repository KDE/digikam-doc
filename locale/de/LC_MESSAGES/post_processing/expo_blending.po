"No matter how good your camera is, taking a well-exposed photo of a high-"
"contrast scene like a black bird on snow can be really tricky. Even if you "
"switch to the manual mode and tweak the exposure settings, there is still a "
"risk that you will end up with a shot containing under or over-exposed "
"areas. One way to solve this problem is to use the digiKam Exposure "
"Blending. This technique involves taking several shots of the same scene or "
"subject with different exposures (**bracketing**) and then fusing these "
"shots into one perfectly exposed photo."

"While exposure blending sounds simple in theory, achieving usable results "
"can be a rather laborious and time-consuming process. Fortunately, digiKam "
"can do the donkey job for you. The exposure blending tool relies on the "
"`Hugin command line tools <https://hugin.sourceforge.io/>`_ for processing "
"and fusing photos, so you must install it on your machine beforehand."

"You can also exclude individual photos from the stack on the top right "

"the previous versions. You can then save all the generated versions, or save "
"only the one you like most by selecting wanted preview. The output format to "

"already exists, it can be overwritten or not. A common template file name "
