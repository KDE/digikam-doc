"A panorama is a composite of multiple photos taken in the same conditions "
"with the same camera/lens. The camera is rotated about a single point "
"between each shot, so the end photos can be stitched together as if shot "
"with a super wide-angle lens. The sequential images must be taken with "
"overlapping edges. The Panoramic Algorithm will try to find the common "
"portions of the images to join and merge the contents. The get the most "
"consistent perspective, it is best to use a tripod, especially with complex "
"compositions. The **Panorama Creator** tool allows you to assemble shots "
"taken horizontally, vertically, or as a matrix."

"The option **Detect moving skies** allows an automatic detection of clouds "

"be more precise, the process discards any points that are associated with a "
"possible cloud during the selection of control points. This is useful to "
"prevent moving clouds from altering the control points matching process used "
"by the algorithms. Depending on the scene contents, turn on the option and "
"press **Next** button to pre-process items."
