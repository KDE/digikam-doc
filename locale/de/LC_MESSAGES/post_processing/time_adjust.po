"The Time Adjust tool available from :menuselection:`Item --> Adjust Time & "
"Date` :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+D` allows to tune or records the timestamps in file "
"metadata. This common task is sometime mandatory when your images do not "
"contain dates in metadata as when contents is digitized with a scanner, or "
"when a camera records a wrong date in you file due to a bad device settings. "
"With this tool you can choose the right source to take the date information, "
"the date entries to fix or append, and the calculation to operate on dates "
