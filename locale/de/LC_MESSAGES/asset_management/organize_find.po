"digiKam provides a number of methods to classify photographs: filenames, "
"albums, collections, time-stamp, tags, rating, GPS position and captions. As "
"if this was not enough, you can search many standard metadata items like "
"camera model, lens, coordinates, image size and many more. Metadata "
"categories as listed here are in fact different **views** of your photo "
"library. Combining these views is the very powerful method to narrow down "
"the search for a file and to find it quickly. Imagine having 800 photos of "
"your loved one. Searching for **Salagou**, having more than **3 rating "
"stars**, shot in **France** will surely leave you with very few candidates. "
"In terms of selection criteria for a DAM system, digiKam fares very well in "
"terms of completeness, versatility, speed, scalability, accuracy and "
"openness."

"The key thing to remember is that you don't know how you or somebody else "

"events in a different context, it's a fact of life. So if you can narrow "
"down your search by remembering place or time or camera or theme or rating "
"or owner you stand an infinitely better chance to find it quickly than by "
"just one of those criteria or none. At the beginning, at the time of taking "
"a photograph, all metadata is in your head (except for the Exif data). If "
"you do not transcribe some of it into your DAM system, it will be lost "

"One distinction has to be interjected here between **private** and **public "

"be considered private as they stay in the database and go nowhere else. By "

"The first thing to do and to know before you put anything onto your system "
"is to build an information structure (as opposed to data structure). Your "

"The organization should be simple, unified and scalable, and it should be "

"much to ask for, but keep them small enough so that they can fit into a "
"backup medium like an optical drive. Remember that the archive will grow all "
"the time. The concrete type of structure depends on your use case of course: "
"Lets take a simple yet frequent example: you are a casual photographer "
"taking pictures of your private life, your family, holidays and so on. It "
"could be efficient to create a structure based on years plus some holiday "
"and export containers. It could look like this:"

msgid ""
"Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. Holiday pictures can be quickly "

"will be organized by date. If you shoot enough pictures you want to create "
"sub folders below the years as months e.g. 2008-01, 2008-02 etc. *Export* "

"sooner than you believe. The numbering scheme of that new camera will start "
"over at typically IMG_0001.JPG again, creating identical file names to the "
"ones you have already if you do not rename them. By renaming you lessen the "
