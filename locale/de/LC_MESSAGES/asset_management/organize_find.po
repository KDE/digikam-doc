"digiKam provides a number of methods to classify photographs: filenames, "
"albums, collections, time-stamp, tags, rating, GPS position and captions. As "
"if this was not enough, you can search many standard metadata items like "
"camera model, lens, coordinates, image size and many more. Metadata "
"categories as listed here are in fact different **views** of your photo "
"library. Combining these views is the very powerful method to narrow down "
"the search for a file and to find it quickly. Imagine having 800 photos of "
"your loved one. Searching for **Salagou**, having more than **3 rating "
"stars**, shot in **France** will surely leave you with very few candidates. "
"In terms of selection criteria for a DAM system, digiKam fares very well in "
"terms of completeness, versatility, speed, scalability, accuracy and "
"openness."

"The key thing to remember is that you don't know how you or somebody else "

"down your search by remembering place or time or camera or theme or rating "
"or owner you stand an infinitely better chance to find it quickly than by "
"just one of those criteria or none. At the beginning, at the time of taking "
"a photograph, all metadata is in your head (except for the Exif data). If "
"you do not transcribe some of it into your DAM system, it will be lost "

"have all camera settings of every shot, lens data like zoom, focus, aperture "
"etc., date and time, shooting location, copyrights, authorship, program "
"used, and more. Not bad, isn't it? But we could have done more during the "
"importing, we could have changed the file names to include the date, or "
"place or theme, we could have changed the format to a lossless 16 bit per "

"savvy. You will buy a new camera one day or you have a second one already, "
"sooner than you believe. The numbering scheme of that new camera will start "
"over at typically IMG_0001.JPG again, creating identical file names to the "
"ones you have already if you do not rename them. By renaming you lessen the "

"A ranking systematic is implemented in digiKam by the 5 star rating tool. In "

"saving them into IPTC metadata a translation of levels ensures compatibility "
"with other programs). Rating is rapidly applied with digiKam using keyboard "
"shortcuts or the mouse on single photographs or whole selections. The rating "
"can then be entered as a search criterion or directly from the status bar "
"quick filters. However, before you start attributing stars everywhere take a "
"moment to establish personal criteria for ranking. Best practice is to write "
"down your personal match of stars to some qualitative expression, that will "
"define what you actually mean when giving 5 stars. Generally there should be "
"much less images rated with increasing star assignment. A ratio of 3-10 "
"between each level has proven useful."

"Amazing? Yes, and 16807 of them you didn't have to rate at all! You even can "
"define a different rating scheme depending on the kind of use, 2 stars for "
"commercial use, may mean something else than 2 stars holiday photos. It is "
"also a good practice to define a neutral rating, everything below is "
"actually a negative rating. This will help you culling and thinning your "
"collection very efficiently. Or you could define purposes to ratings, say 0 "
"stars for 'can throw away', 1 star for images in quarantine (decide later), "
"2 stars for gallery export, 3 stars for printing, 4 stars for selling, 5 "
"stars for 'have to work on', as you please. It must suit your needs. The "
