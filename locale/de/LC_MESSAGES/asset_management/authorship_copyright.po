"One of the last steps in tagging your digital images may be to add "
"authorship, ownership, and copyright tags. Unlike 'the good(?) old days' of "
"paper copies, the ubiquitous Internet makes it just too easy to 'steal' a "
"picture from a web site. At the very least, all images that will be exported "
"and/or published in any form, should have embedded authorship and copyright "
"information as part of their metadata. Including this information allows you "
"to legally prohibit others from reproducing, adapting, or distributing "
"copies of your work."

"Alternatively, you should embed authorship and **copyleft** information into "

"Copyleft, a play on the word copyright, is the practice of using copyright "
"law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a "
"work for others and requiring that the same freedoms be preserved for "
"modified versions."

"Copyleft licensing often gives every person who receives a copy of a work "
"permission to reproduce, adapt or distribute the work as long as any "
"resulting copies or adaptations are also bound by the same copyleft "
"licensing scheme. A widely used copyleft license is the GNU General Public "
"License. Similar licenses are available through Creative Commons - called "
"Share-alike."

"**Author Names** (synonymous with Creator and By-line): This field should "
"contain your name, or the name of the people who created the photograph. If "
"it is not appropriate to add the name of the photographer (for example, if "
"the identity of the photographer needs to be protected), the name of a "
"company or organization can be used. Once saved, this field should not be "
"changed by anyone. This field supports the use of semi-colons as a separator."

"**Author Position** (synonymous with By-line title): Linked to Author. This "
"field should contain the job title or position of the photographer. Examples "
"might include titles such as: Staff Photographer, Freelance Photographer, or "
"Independent Commercial Photographer. Since this is a qualifier for the "
"Author field, the Author field must also be filled out."

"**Credit** (synonymous to Provider): Use the Provider field to identify who "
"is providing the photograph. This does not necessarily have to be the "
"author. If a photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or "
"the Associated Press, these organizations could be listed here as they are "
"'providing' the image for use by others. If the image is a stock photograph, "
"then the group (agency) involved in supplying the image should be listed "
"here."

"**Copyright**: The Copyright Notice should contain any necessary copyright "
"notice for claiming the intellectual property, and should identify the "
"current owner(s) of the copyright for the photograph. Usually, this would be "
"the photographer, but if the image was done by an employee or as work-for-"
"hire, then the agency or company should be listed. Use the form appropriate "
"to your country. For the United States you would typically follow the form "
"of Â© {date of first publication} name of copyright owner, as in 'copr 2005 "
"John Doe.' The word 'copyright' or the abbreviation 'copr' shall be used in "
"place of the (c) symbol as only ASCII characters are allowed. In some "
"foreign countries only the copyright symbol is recognized and the "
"abbreviation does not work. Using something like (c) where the parentheses "
"form a partial circle is not sufficient. For additional protection "
"worldwide, use of the phrase, 'all rights reserved' following the notice "
"above is encouraged. In Europe you would use: Copyright {Year} {copyright "
"owner}, all rights reserved. In Japan, for maximum protection, the following "
"three items should appear in the copyright field of the IPTC Core: (a) the "
"word, Copyright; (b) year of the first publication; and (c) name of the "
"author. You may also wish to include the phrase *all rights reserved*."

"individual, an agency, or a member of an agency. To aid in later searches, "
"we suggest separating any slashes '/' with a blank space. Use the form "
"'photographer / agency' rather than 'photographer/agency.' The source may "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whereas filling-in the author and copyright sections provides some legal "
"protections, these fields do not protect against fraud. Anyone with a bit "
"more than basic computer knowledge can delete or modify embedded image "
"metadata. The solution to this problem is called *digital watermarking*. "
"This might be of little interest to amateur photographers, but digital "
"watermarking is really important for professionals and semi-professionals."

msgid ""
"Digital Watermarking refers to an invisible digital watermark that is "
"impressed on photographs as an element of Digital Rights Management (DRM). "
"The watermark contains the same information of authorship and copyright as "
"described above, but the metadata is encrypted and saved in the actual image "
"data (as opposed to the metadata section which is a separate section within "
"the image file)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../asset_management/authorship_copyright.rst:69
msgid ""
"This invisible imprint has holographic properties so that modifications done "
"to an image (size, color, crop, up to a certain limit) will not destroy the "
"copyright information. Only when an image is resized to a very small "
"fraction like a thumbnail will the embedded information be lost, but then "
"the image is of no value anymore to the copyright infringing party. The "
"digital watermark will be unique per image."
