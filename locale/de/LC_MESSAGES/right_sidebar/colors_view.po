"An image can be decomposed into **Red**, **Green** and **Blue** color "
"channels. **Alpha** channel is a Layer in the image that supports "
"transparency (like PNG or GIF images). Each channel supports a range of "
"intensity levels from 0 to 255 (integer valued). Thus, a black pixel is "
"encoded by 0 on all color channels; a white pixel by 255 on all color "
"channels. A transparent pixel is encoded by 0 on the alpha channel; an "
"opaque pixel by 255."

"With the **Scale** option you can determine whether the histogram will be "

"histogram will often be dominated by a single bar. In this case a "
"**Logarithmic** histogram will be more useful."
