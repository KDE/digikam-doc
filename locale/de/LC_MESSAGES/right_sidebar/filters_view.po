"The **Filters** tab is used to limit the set of images displayed in the "
"Image Area. Normally one uses the Left Sidebar with its different views to "
"confine the images displayed for example to the content of an album or to "
"images with a certain label assigned to them. The **Filters** tab on the "
"Right Sidebar offers a number of filters and if one of these are filled in, "
"selected or checked only the cross-section of these two selections will be "
"displayed in the Image Area."

"To give an example, suppose you have a tag called *public* which tags all "
"images except your private ones. Then you can check this *public* tag in the "
"Right Sidebar to hide the private images (all those not having *public* "
"tag). Whatever view mode you chose from the Left Sidebar, only *public* "
"images will be displayed. Another typical example is the selection of a "
"subset of tags in a hierarchical tree. Suppose you want to display *red* and "
"*green* from a tag tree containing 7 different colors as sub-tags. Simply "
"click on the *color* tag of the main view and check *red* and *green* from "
"the Right Sidebar."

"You can also use a combination of the filters but here we have to look a "
"little bit closer: The main filters and also the different types of labels "
"in the **Labels Filter** (color, pick, rating) are connected with boolean "
"AND which means that all selected filters have to fit for the images to be "
"displayed. If you select **JPG** in the **MIME type Filter** and *red* in "
"the **Labels Filter** only those photographs from the selection on the Left "
"Sidebar will be displayed that have JPG format AND are labeled *red*."

"On the other hand the tags in the tag filter and the individual labels "
"within one type of labels are connected with boolean OR as you might have "
"noticed already in the public/private example above. That means if you check "
"more than one tag in the **Tags Filter** all images with at least one of "
"these tags applied will show up (as long as they are not ruled out by one of "
"the other filters)."

"Another use of this tab of the Right Sidebar is drag and drop tagging. Let's "
"say you chose with the help of the Left Sidebar a number of images to tag "
"them and they are now displayed in the Image Area. If the tag already "
"exists, simply drag it from the Right Sidebar onto one of the icons. A "
"dialog will pop-up and ask if this tag should be applied to this item only, "
"to all items or, if there is more than one icon selected (highlighted), to "
"the selected items."

"In the above example the main window shows the images from an album, the tag "
"filter is set to 'Lieux', which reduces the set to 3 images. In the "
"**Geolocation Filter**, we select **Images With Coordinates** which leaves "
"only one picture from the list of items including GPS information. Then a "
"tag is dragged from the **Tag Filter** over the icon and dropped. A pop-up "
"dialog asks if the tag shall be applied to this item only or to all "
"(displayed) items."

"Note that the **Text Filter** has a little drop-down menu to select which "
