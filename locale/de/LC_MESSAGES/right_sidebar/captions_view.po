"This sidebar tab serves to apply and edit image attributes like captions, "
"rating, date and tags. The attributes are stored in the associated database, "
"in the IPTC, XMP, and Exif data fields and become part of the image. All "
"attributes are accessible in one sidebar view as shown in the screenshot "
"below. During image reading the order of priority is a) database b) XMP/IPTC "
"and c) Exif. So if there is a discrepancy between any of the three, this "
"priority will take effect and a synchronization will take place. This "
"sidebar has a first-previous-next-last arrow navigator field on top if shown "
"in the main application."
