"digiKam is a powerful tool with a lot of features but all the different menu "
"entries, buttons and shortcuts can be sometimes confusing. The User Manual "
"is important for beginners as well as advanced users searching for a "
"specific feature. However maintaining the manual is a big task the digiKam "
"core team can't handle alone..."

"And thatâ€™s were you come in. If you are an advanced user then we need you to "
"update old sections or write explanations of new features. But even if you "
"have the feeling you are not experienced enough to write something, you can "
"still update screenshots or translate in different languages. If you benefit "
"from the work others did on digiKam it is a great (and easy) opportunity to "
"give something back to the project and the community."

"There are many ways that you can get involved with the continued development "

"documentation, translation and user interface design, or just contribute "
"really good ideas to the wish-list. You can also get involved by testing "
"early development code as it is being developed and providing feedback to "
"the developers. Of course, if you are a software developer then you can help "
"to make digiKam the best digital photograph application there is."
