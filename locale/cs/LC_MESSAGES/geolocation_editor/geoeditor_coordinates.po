"GPS track data is invariably recorded in UTC (Universal Time Coordinated). "
"If your camera is set to timestamp images in UTC, then you are all set. "
"Otherwise, you'll need to use the **Camera Time Zone** setting to allow "
"digikam to convert the image time stamps to UTC. Select **Same As System** "
"if you took the photographs in your home time zone and digiKam will set the "
"difference to UTC based on your system time. If you took the photographs "
"somewhere else, you have to check **Manual** and choose the appropriate time "
"zone difference from the drop-down field to the right. You can also use the "
"**Offset of pictures** setting to correct for smaller mis-adjustment of your "
"camera's clock. This allows you to add or subtract a specified number of "
"hours, minutes and seconds from the image time stamps. None of these "
"corrections will affect your images, but are used in correlating the image "
"timestamps with the GPS tracks."

"If **Match directly** is selected, the **Max. Time Gap (sec.)**: setting "
"specifies the limit that GPS time and camera time are deemed to be "
"coincident. The maximum value is 2000 seconds. This means that if no entry "
"in the gpx-file exactly matches the time stamp of the photograph, the "
"position of the entry with the smallest time gap to the photograph will be "
"assigned to it as long as this time gap is smaller than the **Max. time gap "
"(sec.)** setting. If you wonder what value you should specify here, a look "
"into the settings of your track recording device/software or into the gpx-"

"of the photograph is calculated using linear interpolation from the "
"positions of the two closest entries in the gpx-file and the respective "
"differences in time. If, for instance, the time gaps between the two closest "
"entries and the photograph are equal, the position assigned will be on a "
