"Geolocation means assigning, editing and using metadata which describe the "
"geographic place where images or videos were taken. The source of these "
"metadata can be your camera, a separate GPS receiver or other means of "
"geographical information, in particular maps."

"Geolocation is not just a tool for professional photographers, there are a "
"variety of reasons for linking an image to a precise geographical location. "
"While not everyone will acquire images with automatic GPS data recording, "
"many people including environmental planners, military, police, construction "
"bureaus, and real estate agencies, can benefit from image geolocation."

"But even amateur photographers find geotagging useful. If enough time has "
"passed that you forget where an image was taken, it is nice to open a map "
"with a simple click to display the locations of your images. And if you want "
"to send your image to someone else, they too can see where the image was "
"taken. Or maybe you simply need to better document the picture. In any case, "
"having position data stored in a photo is great."

"GPS (global positioning system) is used as a generic term throughout this "
"document. It just means a location in the common spherical coordinate system "
"that can be displayed on a map. The actual technical implementation that "
"provides the actual position data can be the American GPS, the Russian "
"GLONASS, the European GALILEO, China's BeiDou or any other system that might "
"come on line in the future."
