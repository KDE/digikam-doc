"When first looking at an image, the eye of the viewer rarely settles at the "

"then from the lower left to the right again. This pattern is unconscious but "
"has been well documented. It is probably associated with the western reading "
"pattern. From the photographer's point of view, the goal then becomes to "
"guide the gaze of the viewer to the subject, being aware of the way many "
"people perceive an image."

"The **Composition Guide** settings provides guiding elements to better "

msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/transform_tools.rst:105
msgid ""
"**Rule of Thirds**: a grid that divides the image into thirds in every "
"direction (that makes for 9 parts). These proportions are close to the "
"golden rule and are derived from the field of view of the human eye. They "
"are often used with slight variations throughout a large number of commonly "
"used objects. Within that frame there are precise areas where the important "
"parts of the image should be placed. The same principle is used to determine "
"the position of the horizon and the proportion of ground to sky. Many "
"photographers and artists are aware of the Rule of Thirds, where an image is "
"divided into three sections vertically and horizontally and the points of "
"intersection represent places to position important visual elements. Moving "
"a horizon in a landscape to the position of one third is often more "
"effective than placing it in the middle, but it could also be placed near "
"the bottom one quarter or sixth. There is nothing obligatory about applying "
"the Rule of Thirds. In placing visual elements for effective composition, "
"one must assess many factors including color, dominance, size and balance "
"together with proportion. Often a certain amount of image balance or tension "
"can make a composition more effective."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/transform_tools.rst:107
msgid ""
"**Harmonious Triangles**: harmonious divisions rely on the principle of "
"similarity. Like the Rule of Thirds guide, Harmonious Triangles are another "
"division of the image using a rectangle into equiangular harmonious "
"triangles aligned with the diagonal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/transform_tools.rst:109
msgid ""
"**Golden Mean**: the Golden Mean is a ratio underlying numerous growth "
"patterns throughout nature (from the spiral of a Nautilus shell to the "
"petals of a sunflower), it has an uncanny way of showing up in all kinds of "
"things we deem beautiful. The Golden Ratio is the irrational number "
"1.618033988..., and it is usage dates back to the ancient Egyptians and "
"Greeks who used it in the construction of their temples and pyramids. "
"Artists and architects throughout time have used the Golden Ratio when "
"composing their paintings, buildings, and even photographs, in order to give "
"their creations a sense of natural order and beauty. The ratio is inherent "
"in the Fibonacci series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 etc.., where each "
"succeeding number after 1 is equal to the sum of the two preceding numbers. "
"The ratio formed 1:1.618 is the Golden Mean. A composition following this "
"rule is considered visually harmonious. The Golden Mean provides more fluid "
"guidelines when used to compose an image. These guides are listed below:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/transform_tools.rst:111
msgid ""
"The **Golden Spiral** guide will increase your odds of getting captivating "
"results in your photographs. As opposed to Rule of Thirds, the Golden Spiral "
"forms a fluid line for the eye to trace through the image. This style of "
"composition will invite the viewer's gaze into the image along the line of "
"the spiral, creating a more symmetrical visual flow, and an overall "
"compelling viewing experience. See below an image composition example using "
"golden spiral."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/transform_tools.rst:113
msgid ""
"One more rule is a **Golden Spiral Sections** (or Golden Rectangles). These "
"rectangles are used to build the Golden Spiral. There should be something "
"leading the eye to the center of the composition. It could be a line or "
"several subjects. This \"something\" could just be there without leading the "
"eyes, but it would make its job."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/transform_tools.rst:115
msgid ""
"The **Golden Triangles** is a derivative of the Golden Spiral discussed "
"above. Its vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the Golden Rectangle. "
"Note that unlike Harmonious Triangles, Golden Triangles aren't equiangular "
"triangles. Placing diagonals along these lines can make an otherwise static "
"subject appear more dynamic. When you use Golden Triangles to break up your "
"frame, you're creating an effect professional photographic experts call "
"Dynamic Symmetry. Try to keep your focal subject on one of the intersecting "
"points, and place other visual information into the triangles you've already "
"divided out. The result will be a very attractive composition you may not "
"have otherwise attained."
msgstr ""

#: ../../image_editor/transform_tools.rst:117
msgid ""
"Like the Rule of Thirds the **Golden Sections** affects the ratio of an "
"image size as well as the placement of the main subjects on the photo. This "
"ratio is close to the 35mm ratio, so you don't need to change the size of "
"the photo in most cases. But you need to consider the composition: the main "
"subject should lie on one of the four lines or four intersections (subject's "
"eye for example). Truthfully speaking, these rules are not the same. Rule of "
"Thirds is a simplified version of the Golden Mean."

"The tool works by finding so-called *seams* over an image, i.e. continuous, "

"seams), or from left to right (*horizontal* seams). When one such seam, say "
"a vertical one, is removed from an image (the *carving* operation), the "
"width of the image is reduced by one pixel. Removing horizontal seams "
"reduces the height. Iterating such operations (find a seam and remove it), "
"one can reduce the image size at will. Collecting together all the seams "
"which were carved from an image, in their respective order, constitutes what "
"is called a *seams map*."

"In order to get good results from this technique, the main issue is finding "

"are less likely to cross high-energy areas."
