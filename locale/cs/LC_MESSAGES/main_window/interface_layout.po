"digiKam's main window has two areas in the center showing your photographs. "
"One is the **Icon Area**, showing thumbnails of the content of the selected "
"album or of a search result, and the other one the **Preview**, showing the "
"selected image. Together let's call them the :ref:`Image Area <image_view>`. "
"In the top left corner of the preview we have a few buttons for moving back "
"and forth through the content of the album, for rotating the image, for "
"showing or adding face tags and to switch to full screen mode. By clicking "
"on the preview you can make it disappear and by clicking on the picture area "
"of a thumbnail open it again."

"Left Sidebar lets you switch between nine “Views”: Albums (shown here), "
"Tags, Labels, Dates, Timeline, Search, Similarity, Map and People (Tags). "
"The Right Sidebar can be used to show all information about your images and "
"partly also to edit them. You can use all these views to organize and find "
"your photographs. If you click on one of the buttons on the sidebars there "
"will fold out another area, offering possibilities to select, to make "
"inputs, e.g. for searches, to edit data and to show information."
