"The **Filters** tab is used to limit the set of images displayed in the "
"Image Area. Normally one uses the Left Sidebar with its different views to "
"limit which images are displayed. For example, selecting an album in the "
"Left Sidebar limits the content in the Image Area to images in that album, "
"while selecting a label in the Left Sidebar limits the content in the Image "
"Area to images with that assigned label. The **Filters** tab on the Right "
"Sidebar offers a number of filters which if selected, will further limit the "
"content displayed in the Image Area."

"To give an example, suppose you have a tag called *public* which tags all "
"images except your private ones. Then you can check this *public* tag in the "
"Right Sidebar to hide the private images (all those do not have the *public* "
"tag). Then whatever view mode you chose from the Left Sidebar, only *public* "
"images will be displayed."

"Another typical example is the selection of a subset of tags in a "
"hierarchical tree. Suppose you want to display *red* and *green* from a tag "
"tree containing 7 different colors as sub-tags. Simply click on the *color* "
"tag in the Left Sidebar and check *red* and *green* in the Right Sidebar."

"You can also use a combination of the filters, but that requires a little "
"more explanation. Image selection is based in the boolean AND of all of the "
"different filter types in the Filter sidebar. This include the Text, MIME "
"Type, Geolocation, Tags, and Face Tags filters, along with the color, pick, "
"and rating filters in the **Labels Filter** section. These means that all "
"selected filters have to be satisfied for an image to be displayed. If you "
"select **JPG** in the **MIME type Filter** and *red* in the **Labels "
"Filter** only those photographs from the selection on the Left Sidebar will "
"be displayed that have JPG format AND are labeled *red*."

"On the other hand, the tags in the tag filter and the individual labels "
"within one type of labels are connected with boolean OR, as you might have "
"noticed already in the public/private example above. That means if you check "
"more than one tag in the **Tags Filter** all images with at least one of "
"these tags applied will show up (as long as they are not ruled out by one of "
"the other filters)."

"Another use of the Right Sidebar's Filter tab is drag and drop tagging. "
"Let's say you chose a numbers of images to display using the Left Sidebar. "
"In order to apply an existing tag to a selection of these images, simply "
"drag the tag from the Right Sidebar onto an image. A dialog will pop-up and "
"ask if this tag should be applied to this item only, to all (displayed) "
"items, or to the selected items in the case that more than one icon was "
"selected. Images can also be tagged by dragging the image(s) onto the tag in "
"the Right Sidebar."

"In the above example the main window shows the images from an album, the tag "
"filter is set to 'Lieux', which reduces the set to 3 images. In the "
"**Geolocation Filter**, we select **Images With Coordinates** which leaves "
"only one picture from the list of items including GPS information. Then a "
"tag is dragged from the **Tag Filter** over the icon and dropped. A pop-up "
"dialog asks if the tag shall be applied to this item only or to all "
"(displayed) items."

"Note that the **Text Filter** includes a drop-down menu to select which "

"the **Labels Filter** has a drop-down menu to choose whether you want a "
