"You can change digiKam's primary language from the :menuselection:`Settings "
"--> Configure Language...` menu item. This opens a dialog where you can "
"select the **Primary language** and add an optional **Fallback language**. "
"The primary language determines which translated strings will be used in the "
"application, and this will be your native language. The fallback language is "
"used to fill-in translations if any internationalized strings are missing "
"from the primary set of strings."

"Translating an application such as digiKam is a long task and requires a lot "
