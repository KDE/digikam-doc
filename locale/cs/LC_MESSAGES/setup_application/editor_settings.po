"**Quality**: digiKam offer us many alternatives e.g the most common are "
"**Bilinear**, **VNG**, and **AAHD** interpolations. It seems that AAHD (for "
"Ameliored Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) is the best choice for quality "
"according to some test that we have performed and the paper of the person "
"that implemented it. This improved method based on **AHD** interpolation, "
"selects the direction of interpolation so as to maximize a homogeneity "
"metric, thus typically minimizing color artifacts. VNG (for Variable Number "
"of Gradients) was the first algorithm used by libraw but suffers from color "
"artifacts on the edge. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for speed "
"with a acceptable result. **PPG** (for Patterned-Pixel-Grouping) is a pixel "
"grouping interpolation that uses assumptions about natural scenery in making "
"estimates. It has fewer color artifacts on natural images than the VNG "

"**Highlights**: Default is here to consider highlights (read: part of your "

"the unclip option which will paint the highlights in various pinks. At last "
"you can try to consider recovering some parts of the missing information "
"from the highlights with **Rebuild** option. This is possible because the "
"blue pixels tends to saturate less quickly than the greens and the reds. "
"digiKam will try to reconstruct the missing green and red colors from the "
"remaining none saturated blue pixels. Of course here everything is a "
"question of tradeoff between how much color or white you want. If you select "
"Reconstruct as the option, you will be given the choice to set a **Level**. "
"A value of 3 is a compromise and can/should be adapted on a per image basis. "
