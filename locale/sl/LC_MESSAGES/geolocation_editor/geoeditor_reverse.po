"In this tab you can use a public geoname service to look up address details "
"of the geographic position of one or more images and convert them into tags. "
"In order to do that you need a few preparations. You should be already "
"familiar with the idea of tags and how to create, edit and use them. The "
"best entry into this issue you find in the Tags View section of Chapter 2 of "
"the digiKam handbook."

"These red tags in curly brackets are called control tags. They determine "
"which address elements you want the reverse geolocation service you have "
"chosen at the top under **Select Service** to look for. You can still delete "
"some of them with the help of the context menu if you feel that you don't "
"need them or modify the structure by deleting some control tags and add them "
"in other places of the tree or even build a new tree parallel to the first "
"by adding a control tag to the root tag (here: Location). Arranging the "
"control tags on the same level instead of a tree structure can save a lot of "
"redundant tags since the same city or town name exists in more than one "
"state or country let alone street names. But it can make the whole location "
"branch of your tag tree quite long and therefore incalculable. This is to "
"say that you have to find your own solution to this problem depending on "
"your needs, maybe a mix, and the sooner you find it the less work you have "
"to invest in editing your tag tree and the control tags."
