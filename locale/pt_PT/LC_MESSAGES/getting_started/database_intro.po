"Everyone knows about a database; it is used to store data. As all other "
"photographs management programs, digiKam too uses the database for some "
"obvious reasons like avoiding data duplication, reducing data redundancy, a "
"quick search engine, and greater data integrity. Moreover, the cost of data "
"entry, storage and retrieval are drastically reduced. Additionally, any user "
"can access the data using query language."
