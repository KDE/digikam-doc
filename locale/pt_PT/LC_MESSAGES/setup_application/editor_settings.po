"according to some test that we have performed and the paper of the person "

"selects the direction of interpolation so as to maximize a homogeneity "
"metric, thus typically minimizing color artifacts. VNG (for Variable Number "
"of Gradients) was the first algorithm used by libraw but suffers from color "
"artifacts on the edge. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for speed "
"with a acceptable result. **PPG** (for Patterned-Pixel-Grouping) is a pixel "
