Installation
============

.. contents::

Visit `the download page <https://www.digikam.org/download/>`_ of the digiKam Web site for up to date information on installing stable **digiKam**.

Youâ€™ll find all previous digiKam versions in the `attic <https://download.kde.org/Attic/digikam/>`_.

.. note::

    Bundles using the **-debug** in file-name includes debug symbols to catch debugger traces when application stop to work. Files are more heavy but this will help developers to found the origin of dysfunctions.

Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------

- **Operating System**: 64-bit Windows 7 or newer, Apple macOS 64-bit based on Intel or M1 architecture, 64-bit Linux. Details see below.

- **CPU**: x86 Intel or AMD; at least one 2 GHz core for standard photo processing, 4 cores for large photo or panorama processing, 8 cores for deep-learning uses as with face detection and image quality sorting. Details see below.

- **GPU**: OpenGL 2.0 that works correctly and is compatible. On Windows, you can also use a card with good, compatible DirectX 9 or 11 drivers.

- **RAM**: At least 4 GB for standard photo processing, 8 GB for large photo or panorama processing, 16 GB for deep-learning uses as with face detection and image quality sorting. Details see below.

.. note::

   If your computer is at the lower end of CPU and RAM requirements, you should use both :ref:`Small Thumbnails Resolution <thumbnails_resolution>` and :ref:`Loading Embedded Preview <preview_settings>` features to help reduce preview lag.

- **Monitors**: If the application can be used without problem on a single screen, using multi-screens will improve the experience especially with the workflow to review items.

digiKam on Linux
-----------------

**digiKam** can be installed on non-KDE Desktops without any issues.

**AppImage:** Minimum Ubuntu 18.04 has no such minimal requirements.

`AppImage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppImage>`_ is a bundle hosting all the necessary dependencies to run digiKam. Nothing is installed on your system.
Turn on **executable** property of AppImage file and run it. That all...

.. _windows_requirements:

.. tip::

    The AppImage bundle includes also the :ref:`Showfoto stand Alone Image Editor <showfoto_editor>`. To run it instead digiKam, just add **showfoto** as argument to the AppImage command line, like this:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ./digiKam-8.0.0-x86-64-debug.appimage showfoto

.. note::

    The AppImage provides more options to start which can be listed with **help** argument from command line.

digiKam on Windows

    - **Standalone** version: **Doesn't** need administrator rights and isn't installed. It's **not** listed as a program. Is only accessible for the user who has downloaded the file.

        - If you work with a normal user on your computer, you can use digiKam.

        - You can copy the digiKam folder on any external drive and run it on a different computer without installing it. However, your personal settings and downloads within digiKam are related to the computer you work on.   

Using in a Windows Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use digiKam with domain users with using Windows Active Directory and/or Group Policies (`GPOs <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-objects>`_) make sure all users have read/write rights to the following folders:

.. epigraph::

   %AppData%\\digikam

   %LocalAppData%\\digikam

   %LocalAppData%\\digikamrc

   %LocalAppData%\\digikam_systemrc

   %LocalAppData%\\kxmlgui5\\digikam\digikamui.rc

Similar requirements is also necessary for the :ref:`Showfoto stand Alone Image Editor <showfoto_editor>`:

.. epigraph::

   %AppData%\\showfoto

   %LocalAppData%\\showfoto

   %LocalAppData%\\showfotorc

   %LocalAppData%\\showfoto_systemrc

   %LocalAppData%\\kxmlgui5\\digikam\showfotoui.rc

Do also make sure no GPO is blocking the access to these folders.

digiKam on macOS
-----------------

The non Signed Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**digiKam** runs with Intel based Mac's on macOS 64-bit. For M1 based Mac's, you needs to use `Apple Rosetta 2 <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861>`_ instructions translator. Minimum system requirement depends of the digiKam version to install:

    =============== ===========================================================================================
    digiKam version Supported macOS Release
    =============== ===========================================================================================
    >= 7.10.0        macOS 10.15 (`Catalina <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Catalina>`_) or newer
    >= 7.0.0         macOS 10.13 (`High Sierra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_High_Sierra>`_) or newer
    >= 6.4.0         macOS 10.12 (`Sierra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Sierra>`_) or newer
    >= 6.1.0         macOS 10.11 (`El Capitan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_El_Capitan>`_) or newer
    >= 6.0.0         macOS 10.8 (`Mountain Lion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mountain_Lion>`_) or newer
    =============== ===========================================================================================
    
.. note::

    Due to use `Macports environment <https://www.macports.org/>`_ to build digiKam PKG, and the rolling release Macports policy applied on time, it's difficult to provide a binary compatibility with older versions of macOS. Also Macports packages are frequently updated for security reasons, and this can require more recent macOS SDK.

When the **PKG** file is downloaded, to start the installer, a security warning will appears, because the package is not signed for the Apple Gatekeeper.

    The macOS Warning When you Try to Run digiKam PKG after Downloading

You needs to give the rights to run from the **macOS Config Panel/Security and Confidentiality** to confirm to Gatekeeper that all is safe here.

See below some examples of rights set in the macOS **Security and Privacy** policy configuration panel:

- **Automation**: This right is set when you try to open an album in Apple Finder file manager through digiKam.

Application Updates
-------------------

.. important::

    If you process a major version update, as for example from version 7 to version 8, we recommend to backup :ref:`your database files <database_intro>`, as generally internal schema can changes. Typically, digiKam is able to migrate tables from an older version to a new one, and all is done automatically at startup, but in all cases, it's always better to save these important digiKam files before to upgrade the application. Look also the :ref:`Database Backup <database_backup>` section from this manual for more recommendations.

If you use a bundle as official Linux AppImage, macOS package, or Windows installer, the application can be updated using the :menuselection:`Help --> Check For New Version menu entry`. Look also the updates settings :ref:`in Behavior page <behavior_settings>` from the configuration dialog.
