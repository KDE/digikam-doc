Background
----------

**digiKam** is an advanced digital photo management application for Linux, macOS and Windows desktop. It provides a simple interface which makes importing and organizing digital photographs a *snap*. digiKam enables you to manage large numbers of digital photographs in Albums, organizing these photographs for easy retrieval using tags (keywords), captions, collections, dates, geolocation. It has many features for searching, viewing, organizing, processing and sharing your images. Thus, digiKam is a formidable :ref:`Digital Asset Management <asset_management>` (DAM) program that also includes powerful image editing functions.

The **Import Tool** is an easy-to-use camera interface that will connect to your digital camera and download photographs directly into digiKam Albums. `More than 2000 digital cameras <http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php>`_ are supported by the gPhoto library. Of course, any media or card reader supported by your operating system will also interface with digiKam.

digiKam incorporates a fast **Image Editor** with many image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs, comment and rate them, correct, enhance and alter them. The **Batch Queue Manager** can easily post process images using a variety of tools. And there are many import and export tools dedicated to working with remote web services.

The **Light Table** allows you to visually compare images side by side, making it easy to select the best shots taken from a series.
