    The digiKam Maintenance Options to Find Duplicates

The **Find Duplicates** tool performs the same as the Find duplicates button in the :ref:`Similarity View <similarity_view>`, but here you can combine it with other maintenance operations and you have the chance to speed up the process by checking **Work on all processor cores** under :ref:`Common Options <maintenance_common>`.

This process provides two options for finding duplicate items:

   - **Similarity Range**: the lower and higher values for defining the range of similarity in percents.

   - **Restriction**: this option restricts the duplicate search with some criteria, such as limiting the search to the album of a reference image, or excluding the album of the reference image from the search.

While the find duplicates process is underway, a progress indicator is displayed in the bottom right corner of the main window.
