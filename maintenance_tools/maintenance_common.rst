    The digiKam Maintenance Options to Select Albums

In the **Common Options** section you can restrict the scope of the maintenance process(es) to certain albums or tags. You can un-check **Whole albums collection** or **Whole tags collection** to get access to the drop down fields where you can select specific albums or tags. Note that a context menu in this drop down field allows you to select or deselect children and/or parents and also to invert the selection. If you switch from **Albums** to **Tags** or vice versa your selection in the now grayed out item will remain untouched which might be useful if you need to reuse a certain selection.

    The digiKam Maintenance Options to Select Tags

Since many of the processes the maintenance tool can perform are time consuming (depending on scope), you have the choice to check **Work on all processor cores** if your machine has more than one core and they are not otherwise occupied.

    The digiKam Maintenance Common Options to Process Tools

The **Use the Last Saved Active Tools and Settings** forces digiKam to remember the options selections made at the last maintenance tool session.
