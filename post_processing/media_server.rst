:ref:`Media Server <post_processing>`
=====================================

DLNA Media-Server is used to automatically export digiKam photos through the local network to other `DLNA-compliant devices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance>`_ like smart phones, TV, and tablets.

To start the media-server, head to the **Tools** tab from the **Right Sidebar**. You will find the **Share with DLNA** icon on the list. You can also start it from the :menuselection:`Tools --> Share with DLNA` menu entry. The media-server window will open as follows:

    The DLNA Media-Server Dialog

To share items, just select your desired **Albums** from the nested lists. You can share from physical **Albums**, or virtual **Tags**, **Searches**, and **Labels**. When the selection is done, press the **Start** button, a wheel on the right side will indicate that the server is currently running.

You can hide this media-server window (without closing the actual server) using the **Ok** button. If you want shutdown the server, re-open the Media-Server dialog and press the **Stop** button. Note that the files and folders you specify will be saved for you to use in later sessions.

Use the option **Start Server at Startup** if you want to run the media-server automatically once you start digiKam.
