================

.. contents::

`Mosaic-Wall <https://github.com/scheckmedia/ImageMosaicWall>`_ allows creating an image based on a bunch of other images. It looks like a mosaic effect. This tool is not included in the digiKam source code. Rather, it is a 3rd-party plugin included in binary distributions of digiKam, as the Windows, macOS, and Linux bundles.

First, you need to select one item from your collection to render as a matrix of photo. To start the Mosaic-Wall tool, head to the **Tools** tab from the **Right Side-bar**. You will find the **Image Mosaic Wall** icon on the list. You can also start it from the :menuselection:`Tools --> Image Mosaic Wall` menu entry. The tool dialog will open as follows:
