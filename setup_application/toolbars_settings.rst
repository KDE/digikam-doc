    The digiKam Toolbars Configuration Dialog

On the left side of the toolbar configuration dialog, the available items that you can put in your toolbar are shown. On the right, the ones that already appear on the toolbar are shown. Above each side of the panel there is a Filter text box you can use to easily find items in the list.

You can add an item to your toolbar by selecting it from the left side and clicking on the right arrow button. You can remove an item by selecting it and clicking the left arrow button.

You can change the position of the items by moving them lower or higher in the list. To move items lower, press the down arrow button, while to move items higher press the up arrow button. You can also change items' position by dragging and dropping them.

On horizontal toolbars, the item that's on top will be the one on the left. On vertical toolbars, items are arranged as they appear in the toolbar.

You can add separator lines between items by adding a **--- separator ---** item to the toolbar.

You can restore your toolbar to the way it was when you installed the application by pressing the **Defaults** button at the bottom of the dialog and then confirming your decision.

You can change the icon and text of individual toolbar items by selecting an item and clicking either the **Change Icon...** or **Change Text...** button.
