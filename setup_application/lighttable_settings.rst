:ref:`Light Table Settings <setup_application>`
===============================================

The **Light Table** options for digiKam are set from :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure digiKam... --> Light Table page`. The default setting for the digiKam Light Table can be set here, so that every time you open the Light Table, these settings are activated. (At least if possible -- the synchronous mode does not work with images of different sizes.)

    The digiKam Light Table Configuration Page

**Synchronize Panels Automatically** refers to the **Synchronize** button on the Light Table toolbar, which is to say that you can still switch off this option there.

**Selecting a thumbbar items loads the image to the right panel**: If this option is not enabled you have to load the images from the thumbbar into the two panels of the Light Table by drag+drop or with the **On Left** or **On Right** buttons.

The Full-screen options control the light room display in full screen mode. The default is to show the toolbar, sidebars, and the status bar.
