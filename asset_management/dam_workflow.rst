        Sharpening Details in the Image Editor Using Refocus Tool

- Use external applications for layered editing. This editing may cause the loss or deletion of metadata previously recorded into the images. Back in digiKam, re-apply the metadata recorded in the digiKam database to the edited images.

- Run a routine backup, followed up by data-integrity checks.

- Protect processed images by using Digital Watermarking to encode copyright data. Export to web galleries, slide shows, MPEG encode, contact sheets, printing, etc.
