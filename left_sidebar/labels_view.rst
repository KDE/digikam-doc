        The digiKam Labels Options from Captions Right Sidebar Tab

You may select more than one label by :kbd:`Ctrl+left` click. The selected labels are connected by boolean AND, e.g. selecting Four Star and Yellow will display only photographs that have both labels assigned. You can perform even more sophisticated searches by using the **Filters** section of the :ref:`Right Sidebar <filters_view>`.

.. note::

    The **Pick Labels** properties can be assigned automatically using the deep-learning tool **Image Quality Sorter** which works by analyzing the aesthetic score of items. See the :ref:`Maintenance Tool section <maintenance_quality>` for details.

The **Rating** and **Color** Labels can be used to sort items from your collection during your asset management workflow. See :ref:`this section <rating_ranking>` for details.
