        Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual to want to correct the color contrast and brightness of a photograph. 
        You can experiment with altering the levels of different aspects of your photographs using the tools under the
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Color</guimenu></menuchoice> menu.
        You can see any adjustments you make reflected in the preview. When you are happy with the results, 
        press <guilabel>Ok</guilabel> and they will take effect.

        If your image is washed out (which can easily happen when you take images in bright light) try the Hue/Saturation/Lightness tool, 
        which gives you four sliders to manipulate, for Hue, Saturation, Vibrance, and Lightness. 
        Raising the saturation will probably make the image look better. In some cases, it is useful to adjust the lightness at the same time. 
        ("Lightness" here is similar to "Brightness" in the Brightness/Contrast/Gamma tool, except that they are formed from different combinations 
        of the red, green, and blue channels).

        When you take images in low light conditions, you could get the opposite problem: too much saturation. 
        In this case the Hue/Saturation tool is again a good one to use, only by reducing the saturation instead of increasing it. 
        You can see any adjustments you make reflected in the preview image. 
        When you are happy with the results, press <guilabel>Ok</guilabel> and they will take effect.
