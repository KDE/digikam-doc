        <title>Tree View Settings</title>

        <para>
            These settings permit to customize the tree views of the Left and Right Sidebar. The <guilabel>Tree View icon size</guilabel> option configures the size in pixels of the Tree View icons in &digikam;'s sidebars. Use large value for HiDPI screen.

    <sect3 id="using-setup-views-preview">
        <title>Preview Settings</title>

        <para>
            Instead of opening the image in the editor, the &digikam; preview mode (<keycap>F3</keycap>) will show the image within the main window in the Image Area. The advantage of the preview is that it is faster than opening the image editor and that the icons of the other images remain visible so that you are able to review the list of current images quickly. Depending on your computer features, you can customize the best way to load images into the preview. Raw files can be processed differently, as this kind of container can require long computation.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The first option will try to open a small version of the photograph embedded in the file. It will be found in all RAW files and can be found in all files that support IPTC or XMP like PNG, JPEG, TIFF, JPEG2000, PGF. If an embedded preview cannot be found some image decoders (JPEG, JPEG2000, and PGF, WebP) are able to create a reduced version of the photograph by themselves which is still faster than using the whole image. Depending on the size of the image, the size of the embedded preview and the size available for the preview on your screen the effect of this option can be visible or not.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The second option will always use the full image data for the preview regardless of whether there is a reduced version embedded in the file or not. This can result in a better quality of the preview but is usually slower.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Only if the second option is checked the drop down field to the right of "Raw images:" is accessible. It offers three options: With <guilabel>Automatic</guilabel> selected the Libraw decoder will decode the RAW data automatically without any adjustments from the user. This may lead to weird results sometimes. The algorithm also takes screen resolution and CPU speed into account to achieve an optimum regarding speed and rendering quality. <guilabel>Embedded preview</guilabel> will try to use the (JPEG) preview embedded in RAW files. <guilabel>Raw data in half size</guilabel> will show unprocessed RAW data in half size.
        </para>

        <para>
            The option <guilabel>Preview is zoomed to the original image size </guilabel> is related to the first option. It will zoom the embedded view to the original image size which can lead to a reduced quality of the preview depending on the parameters mentioned above in the description of the first option.
        </para>

        <para>
            The option <guilabel>Show icons and text over preview</guilabel> will show icons for rotation, face tags, full screen mode, &etc; in the top left corner of the image preview and a text indicating which data the preview is showing in the top right corner.
