:ref:`Overview <image_editor>`
==============================

digiKam incorporates a fast Image Editor with a few basic yet powerful image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs and to make corrections and alterations. The Image Editor can be accessed either by clicking on a thumbnail in the Image Window or by clicking with the right mouse button over a thumbnail and selecting **Edit** from the context menu.

The Image Editor provides a number of powerful tools that use you to adjust a photograph.

    The digiKam Image Editor Main Window

The image editor has just one main window with:

    - A status bar at the bottom which shows the filename, the current file number, the current zoom level, and the current image size.

    - A menu bar across the top, and tool bar just below that, for quick access to some commonly used functions.

    - An optional thumb bar (see :menuselection:`Settings --> Show Thumbbar` menu entry) located on the left of canvas. This can be relocated to the top, right, or bottom side by dragging the anchor on the left side of thumb bar to the desired location.
