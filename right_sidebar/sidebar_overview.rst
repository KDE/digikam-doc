:ref:`Overview <right_sidebar>`
===============================

The digiKam main window has a sidebar along the right border that provides important information on selected images, and allows you to take actions on images. This same sidebar (except for the **Filters** tab) is also available in the digiKam Image Editor and the Light Table. The contents of the sidebar can be displayed by clicking on one of the eight tabs:

    - :ref:`Properties <properties_view>`: File and image properties, key shooting parameters.

    - :ref:`Metadata <metadata_view>`: Exif, Makernotes, IPTC, XMP, and ExifTool data.

    - :ref:`Colors <colors_view>`: Histograms and embedded ICC profiles.

    - :ref:`Maps <maps_view>`: View to show GPS locations.

    - :ref:`Captions <captions_view>`: Comments, Date & Time setting, Labels, Rating, Tags, selected metadata.

    - :ref:`Versions <versions_view>`: Image history.

    - :ref:`Filters <filters_view>`: Filters to apply to icon-view selection.

    - :ref:`Tools <tools_view>`: An optional contextual view listing all main tools available, grouped by categories.

Clicking successively on the same tab will make the sidebar pop up or fold back into the border.
