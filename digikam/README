>>> How to Make Screenshot for Manual with Alpha Blending 3D Border <<<

- Never use advanced color theme to make screenshots. Always use KDE default color and icon set.

- Use KSnapshot or Gimp Import to take a shot. Use region selection option to select only
  important area. Remove buttons and dialog header to limit image file size.
  _ALWAYS use PNG file format to save image.

- Open your screenshot in Gimp 2.0 and make operations below:

   * Script-Fu/Decor/Add Border with this options :
      -> Border X Size = 1
      -> Border Y Size = 1
      -> Border Color = black (R:0, G:0, B:0)
      -> Delata Value on Color = 1
   * Image/Flatten Image
   * Script-Fu/Shadow/Drop-Shadow with this options :
      -> Offset X = 5
      -> Offset Y = 5
      -> Blur Radius = 10
      -> Color = black (R:0, G:0, B:0)
      -> Opacity = 80
      -> Allow Resizing = On
   * Save target image in PNG with max compression (Compression Level = 9)
   
Note : A gimp2.[2,3] script from Gerhard Kulzer can be used to add Alpha Blending 3D Border around screenshots. 
       Always use default settings. Script can be downloaded from this url:

!----------Important-------------!
Since the documentation is very good it is also very demanding in terms of volume, 99% whereof are screenshots. In order to limit the byte count to the minimum the following command chain shall be used to reduce the png file size. A factor of 2-4 can be gained. From within the folder where the png reside issue this command (requires pngnq and optipng to be installed on the system):

pngnq -s 1 ./*.png && optipng *-nq8.png && rename -f s/-nq8\.png/.png/ *-nq8.png
