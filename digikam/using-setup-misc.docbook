            With the <guilabel>String comparison type</guilabel> setting, you can sets the way in which strings are compared inside &digikam;.
            This influences the sorting of the tree views. <guilabel>Natural</guilabel> tries to compare strings in a way that regards some 
            normal conventions. The result will be sort naturally even if they have a different number of digits inside. 
            <guilabel>Normal</guilabel> uses a more technical approach. Use this style if you want to entitle albums with 
            ISO dates (201006 or 20090523) and the albums should be sorted according to these dates.

            <guilabel>Scan for new items at startup</guilabel> option will force &digikam; to scan the album library tree for new items added or removed between &digikam; sessions. This may slow down the start time of &digikam;. If any items have been removed from album library, &digikam; will ask you confirmation before to remove definitely item references in database.
