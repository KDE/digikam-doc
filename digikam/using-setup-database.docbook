        <title>The Sqlite Database</title>

        <para>
            <ulink url="https://sqlite.org">SQLite</ulink> is a relational database management system, contained in C programming library. SQLite is not directly comparable to client/server SQL database engines such as MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL. Rather, it is an embedded SQL database engine, &ie; it is embedded in an end program. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. For device-local storage with low writer concurrency and less than a terabyte of content, SQLite is almost always a better solution. SQLite is fast and reliable and it requires no configuration or maintenance. It keeps thing simple. SQLite "just works".
        </para>

        <para>
            By default, &digikam; uses SQLite as its back-end for storing important metadata and thumbnails. Three SQLite files used for storing them are named respectively:

            To make your application run fast and smoothly, it is recommended to check and optimize your databases once in awhile. This could be achieved using sqlite3 packages or sqlite browser (high quality, easy to use visual tool for managing database objects). For Ubuntu and its derivatives, it could be retrieved using <command>sudo apt-get install sqlite3</command> or <command>sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser</command>. Now all remains is to open the terminal, switch to the directory where databases and stored.

            Take care to use a place hosted by fast hardware (such as SSD) with enough free space especially for thumbnails database. A remote file system such as NFS cannot be used here. For performance and technical reasons, you cannot use removable media.

            SQLite database files could be found in your “collection” folder, which you have added to &digikam;. (By default, if you add your “Pictures” collection, the database files will be present in <filename class="directory"> ~/Pictures</filename> folder).

                &digikam; also provides support for popular MySQL database engine. Of course, you might wonder why you’d want to switch to MySQL when SQLite already does a good job of managing the data? MySQL offers many advantages for storing &digikam; data, especially when collections include more than 100,000 items. With such large collections, SQLite introduces latency which slows down the application.
            </para>

            <para>
                Using MySQL as &digikam;’s database back-end allows you to store the data on local as well as remote server. Local, to replace the local SQLite storage and latter, to use a shared computer through network. Using MySQL as &digikam;’s database back-end allows you to store the data on a remote server. This way, you can use multiple &digikam; installations (For instance,on your notebook and PC) to access and manage your photo collections. You can also use MySQL tools to backup and analyze &digikam;’s data.

                While using a large collection, of size greater than 10,000 items, the application tends to slow down.

Instead, it is a server that runs only while application is running.
