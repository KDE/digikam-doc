// 1) It is a language-free URL and we need to send the user to the most language appropriate version for them
// 2) The page has moved elsewhere and we need to send them to the appropriate page
// 3) The request is for a legacy page that existed on the older Mediawiki based setup, in which case we need to once again send them to the most appropriate page
