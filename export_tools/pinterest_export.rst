:ref:`Export To Pinterest <export_tools>`
=========================================

This tool allows the user to upload photos to the Pinterest social network.

`Pinterest <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest>`_ is an image sharing and social media service designed to enable saving and discovery of information on the internet using images, and on a smaller scale, animated images and videos, in the form of pin-boards.

The tool can be used to upload and tweet a selection of images from your collections to the remote Pinterest server using the Internet.

When accessing the tool for the first time from the :menuselection:`Export --> Export to Pinterest` :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I` menu entry, you are taken through the process of obtaining a token which is used for authentication purposes. The following dialog will popup and a browser window will be launched so you can log into Pinterest:

    The Pinterest Export Tool Dialog

By default, the tool proposes to export the currently selected items from the icon-view. The **+** Photos button can be used to append more items to the list.

With the **Album** options, you can select the online folder to store files to upload. You can create a **New Album** or **Reload** the list in the combo-box if the online contents have changed in the Pinterest web interface.

If the **Resize photos before uploading** option is selected, the photos will be resized before transferring to Pinterest. The values will be read from the **JPEG quality** and **Maximum Dimension** settings, which can be used to adjust the maximum height and the compression. The width calculation will be done so as to maintain the aspect ratio.
