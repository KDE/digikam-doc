This tool allows the user to upload photos to the Flickr web service.

`Flickr <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr>`_  is an online photo management application. Flickr is a way to get your photos to the people who matter to you. With Flickr you can show off your favorite photos to the world, blog the photos you take with a smartphone, and securely and privately show photos to your friends and family around the world.

The tool can be used to upload a selection of images from your collections to the remote Flickr server using the Internet.

When accessing the tool for the first time by the :menuselection:`Export --> Export to Flickr` :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R` menu entry, you are taken through the process of obtaining a token which is used for authentication purposes. The following dialog will popup and a browser window will be launched you will log in to Flickr:

    The Flickr Export Tool Dialog

By default, the tool proposes to export the currently selected items from the icon-view. The **+** Photos button can be used to append more items on the list.

With the **Album** options, you can select the online folder to store files to upload. You can **Create** new one and **Reload** the list on the combo-box if online contents have been changed in Flickr web interface.

The **Tag options** section can be used to apply digiKam keywords to the flickr upload. More keywords can be assigned with a series of words (comma separated).

The **Public**, **Friends**, and **Family** check-boxes can be turned on to assign appropriate access permissions to the images you upload. By default the images uploaded are private.

If the **Resize photos before uploading** option is selected, the photos will be resized before transferring to Flickr. The values will be read from the **JPEG quality** and **Maximum Dimension** settings, which can be used to adjust the maximum height and the compression. The width calculation will be done so as to have the aspect ratio conserved.
